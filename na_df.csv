The cause of the issue, IMO, is that ""soft inting"" has no definition for Riot/League. Same as ""trolling."" These are two phrases that have a definition to the person using them at the time, making it completely subjective.
There really isn't any soft inting - you're either intentionally feeding or not. It's still intentional if you're dying on purpose and trying to lose the game even if you're not running it down mid. It's better to think of it as ""purposely trying to lose the game"" rather than in terms of deaths.
What we have is the word ""inting"" being diluted because people use it interchangeably with plain ol' feeding. They're not the same.

This year i was put in bronze, which is slightly annoying cause i dont think I should be in there, but okay. So I am trying to get out of Bronze. Today I go into a match, and pick j4 against a rek-sai (first time against her btw)  The top is darius, mid is lux, and bot is cat, with a shaco support. So i get in, and after leashing, I go level 2 gank and get darius first blood. I then invade their blue side, knowing a bit about rek sai and guessing she will do the same. I then just farm a bit, and go back to top, where i misplay a bit, and get killed by the riven.  I then farm, and try to help mid, who is failing miserably. I get the kill, and farm till dragon. Before dragon, I am told that I lost bot side...which I never went too. Then I try and get dragon, succeed, and my team tries to fight a 2v 4 afterwards, and i die trying to save them. This happens again and again. The point is, I am not a perfect player, but i try and i cant progress up the ladder if there are always trolls. I want advice, and I have thick skin, so let me know what you think.

Iron through to gold+ seems to be all the same. I don't know. I'm  only silver but as far as my experiences go if you have any mental health issues or insecurities DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.  Riots automated ban system is so inconsistent and 99% of the community don't care cause you have access to  make a new account and troll some more cause why not its free. I honestly just don't know anymore i'm thinking its just time to pack it in and let this game go.

So, basically in the last few weeks, i tilt extremely much in the majority of my games:for example when i'm playing jungle and feel all the pressure for my role, or when i'm doing some kind of combo and i screw up something (like missing a point-blank skillshot or seeing that somehow i didn't put ignite on the enemy even though i actually tried to use it, etc. etc.), just to say what happens most of the time.
All of this woudn't be a big problem per se, but as i said lately there is always something that makes me tilt, then i play even worse and all of this spirals out of control.
This is not about the enemy making me tilt (i always have global chat disabled and if i need to i also mute emotes), it's not about my teammates (i play with my premades almost 100% of my games, and luckily i can still manage to not flame them, especially beacuse they don't deserve it, plus they don't flame me too); it's all about ME.
I would like to know how i can stay calm and avoid this because it's really ruining my experience with the game:i think this would allow me to play a little better (but that's not the focus) while also making me a better teammate for my friend and for randoms alike, and considering everything, i love this game and i won't give it up because of a bad period, so i want to have fun while playing it.

Yes, reports do work.Play normals and make sure you play the game for FUN. If I play a lot of ranked and deal with a lot of ppl playing badly, I realize I'm no longer having fun. At that point you need to find the fun in the game again, or play something else for a while. I do this by playing ARAMs or other games completely.You REALLY do play better when you take a break.

0,What I've learned post chat restriction at end of last season.,x Xan Dra x,NA, 120 ,2019-02-28T17:38:08.575+0000,2,"So I got chat restricted at the very end of last season, first ever offense, lost all my honor and eos rewards. I tried to redeem myself with the grace period, but by January was so discouraged with the lack of progress (so few checkpoints after SO many very positive games) and the general frustration of having to go through this for a 10game chat restriction which was a result of calling an inting and baiting-troll a bronzie... (i posted my logs when it happened). 
I stopped playing. I stopped even trying when they took my ranked border, even for the short time it was supposed to be there before the new season launched. I havent logged in to LoL in probably 2 months.  I used to spend so much money on skins and stupid things from Riot games. I wanted to support the game....
So what have I learned?  After 2 months away, I still find my chat restriction silly.  My feelings of whether it was right or wrong are unchanged.  Letting someone lose months of honor progress and earned ranked rewards for what should be a warning is still to me, unfair. That doesnt matter. BUT- There is a great world outside of LoL. Not all game communities are full of the master trolls and negativity that LoL is riddled with. Not all game companies operate like Riot. Gaming can and should be a stress relief, not a source of stress. When the game became a constant source of negativity, and I wanted to respond to it and trolls,  it was time to walk away anyway.
What have I saved?  Probably $200-$300+ on shiny pixels. Ive saved hours I used to spend watching streams and learning strategies, and dedicated them towards other games and my career. 
I guess I am just here to say that at the end of the day, walking away for 2 months has been helpful for me.  I was distraught when I lost all my progress, my rank, my border, the skin I earned through ranked play for what should have been a warning. But none of it mattered. There are more games, and maybe some day ill try league again, but probably wont play competitive ranked. In retrospect so many things seem counter intuitive about the competitive play rewards, chat options, and punishment/honor system that I am okay uninstalling for the foreseeable future. 
If league is causing you stress, Walk away. In 2 months, it wont matter anymore and youll be enjoying new games and new experiences that probably are not as stressful or unbalanced as LoL. Its okay to come back some day or never. And if youre currently in the thick of it, enjoying the competition, the metas and the community, just pulse check occasionally to keep from getting where I ended up. 
Remember to Smile.And from a former support main, for the love of all things good, heal your adc <3

0,Players not filling the roles they are assigned,Abuzedgoat69,NA, 70 ,2019-02-28T05:56:26.533+0000,1,"Dear Riot,
Today I was in the Final Promos for my Top lane role when I encountered a player who did not want to fulfill the role he was assigned. The encounter went something like this. The player asked if he could go Top. I as nicely as I could replied something like ""If it were any other game I would say yes, but this is the final game of my promo series so I am going to have to say no"". I then locked in Garen. This player then decides to lock in Renekton, remove Smite from his summoners and as the game started follow me into the Top lane where he would do everything he could to take as much CS as possible until I figured it would just be better for me to roam the map as at this time the enemy team had started to group.Now Ill be honest, normally I would not write a post about Trolls in a game that seems to be plagued by them, but this situation really bothered me for one specific reason. After the game was done, and the Renekton had racked up a nice 0/5/3 score while the whole time typing at us to ""report him"". The score board said that I had traded positions, that I would have my positional match making system disabled if I were to continue doing this. It really felt like a punch to the gut after having to play that as my final Promo game, and your in game systems claim I am the one who tried to switch positions.Maybe I am over thinking it, and the 4 reports my team mates plus any from the enemy team we were lucky enough to get would clear up the confusion, but I got to say Riot. It is really worrisome when your in game systems that seem like they are put in place to catch and punish the people doing this are getting it completely wrong. Thanks for reading, and I know its probably unlikely, but would really like some feedback from a Dev on this and get their thoughts on this situation.

If the software you use to get the custom skin has any feature that may be considered cheating, regardless of if you use that feature, you can get banned for it.
Use of Riot made skins through custom skin software can get you banned.
Use of skins designed to give you a competitive advantage (outlining where hitboxes will be kind of thing) can get you banned.

Other than that, it's kinda up to you. Last I heard the custom skin community was complaining that Riot's security changes made it harder (if not impossible) to use custom skins.

Gray areas aside, there are definitely applications which are just not okay, and while the number of players in this space are very low (think a fraction of a percentage), we remain vigilant and hand out punishments to those who show patterns of consistent abuse.

0,Unclear Reform Cards,Merciless Beauty,NA, 45 ,2019-02-27T02:13:18.752+0000,3,"I recently got another permanently banned account but when I read my reform card (which is supposed to give me some idea of where I fucked up), I was actually perplexed. In the past, I've been banned for saying some pretty nasty shit (including but not limited to racial slurs - most notably the n-word) and it's pretty obvious why I got banned. Recently however, I got banned again and when I read the reform card, I did not really understand where I had gone wrong. I saw one game's worth of chat logs and the gist of the card (as I read it) was ""you're toxic, here was your last game of chat, bye."" Now I've been trying (unsuccessfully) to reform. I've definitely come a long way from the angry kid who used the n-word and would think he was safe from Riot Games' ban hammer. But in my most recent card, I was completely taken back as to how the decision was made to permanently ban my account. It wasn't until I sent a ticket in to Riot Games' Support that I got a fuller picture of what I had done wrong. I'd gone from being verbally abusive to something worse - griefing. But the card wasn't telling me that. So I had basically gotten two banned accounts for something the card wouldn't even tell me.
Now before anyone asks, no, I did not get on my knees and beg Riot for my accounts back. (Unlike most people, I support their decisions to ban my accounts.) But I find it extremely aggravating that they can't design better reform cards. There has to be a better way. Devs, I'm looking at you guys. I know it's possible to come up with better reform cards that will do a better job of telling people where they went astray.
They're called Reform Cards for a reason. The hope is that seeing them will help someone improve themselves and (should they decide to remain a part of this community) help to  make each game a refreshing experience for all. So help us out here. Right now the only thing the Reform Cards are good at reforming is Verbal Abuse and (maybe) Intentional Feeding. Please. Help us. I doubt all of us want to make new accounts only to lose them over and over again because the Reform Cards are missing the mark.

I know afk at tower for 1 minute at the start of game might seem inconsequential but when I hit blitz pulls over walls in dragon pit and my team isn't there/doesn't respond it makes a difference...

Obviously that's not the case if you just spam ""get fucked"", then it is harassment.Being called a loser or trash or garbage however I'd say it is verbal abuse. Just report and move on, don't send tickets for this shit, you're just wasting people's time, just a report is enough if it's about stuff that's being said in the chat. Only send a ticket after a report if it's about intentionally feeding/griefing.

0,Leaver Punishment Unfair,4204DAZE,NA, 104 ,2019-02-25T21:08:44.760+0000,2,"I was playing jungle in a ranked game today (promo series no less) and was hard carrying the early game before I experienced a short disconnect followed by another short one just before the end of the game due to a snowstorm in my area. The game was close but luckily I was far enough ahead and had spoonfed my bot lane and mid that after I reconnected the second time I was able to get a good flank when they were sieging our base and got a quadra kill and an ace and was able to end the game off that. After the game I got a loss for being tagged a leaver because my power and WiFi went out for a couple minutes. Not only was I bummed but my teammates told me in post game that they were upset that I got the loss and they couldn’t even honor me for the game (they said they wanted to but it wasn’t an option).
I understand the intention of the leaver system because it does suck when someone quits. But when you have a short disconnect for something completely out of your control like the weather but make it back and still hard carry the game it seems unfair to be punished for that.
Not sure how to add a link to my game or a recording of how the game went but feel free to look it up for confirmation. The game was at roughly 9am the day of this posting.
*Edit: I think the main issue is: If the rule is that you are dc/d for at least 3 min you get a lp loss no matter what then there is no incentive to come back. One may argue that not returning to the game is the dominant strategy since in that scenario you are just speeding up the time until you can start a new game where you have something on the line. Perhaps a better system would be if someone disconnects and they return and their team wins then they get no change in their LP. If their team loses or if they don't return then they get the full loss. That way incentives are in place for people to return because I imagine scenarios like this must happen once in a blue moon for everyone. But it still discourages quitting/leaving.

I think I was a little stressed out about my circumstances (mostly the power going out for what looks like will be several days) just after the game ended and wanted to vent. I was trying so hard to get back into the game to help my team that was relying on me so much cuz I didn’t want to let them down. And I succeeded in doing so coming back just in the nick of time to make a base defense ace even though they took both elder and baron In the 3 min I was dc/d! But although I won the battle and was able to save my team with my connection just before it went out for good the win I was able to deliver and redeeme myself through was still given a loss. Basically a “hey good job winning the game and carrying but  you for getting disconnected for a small percentage during the game. Really I was just posting on this forum for support like a “oh geeze that sucks dude”. But that’s not what I got from you and I just saw your comment as a “yeah go  yourself you were disconnected several time” like you were exaggerating the grevious offense I hated that I was putting on my teammates through no action or will of my own.

So yea I have a flaming problem and flaming doesn’t really help anyone win the game but it’s my only way of  venting and whenever I flame or get tilted I end up not thinking what I say and lose control of myself and I don’t think when I get mad and also I REALLY don’t want to get this account perma’d so I’m trying to stop myself from slipping because ONE DAY if I continue my path of uncontrolled rage it will lead me to get banned.

2,I need help on self control...,NoDiscussion,NA, 249 ,2019-02-26T10:52:51.418+0000,2,"You need to learn to have self control on your own which requires for you to stop and think about what you're doing. Insulting people online is different than having a quick tongue irl. You have to type it out in-game and that takes a little bit of time, starting from the moment you decide to flame someone to the point where you begin moving your hands into a typing position.
The only way you'll gain true self control is not by exerting your frustration elsewhere in some sort of way you vent, but learning to take your time and think first before you act. Think about what you're doing and stop yourself of your own free will. 
Doing this will heavily improve your gameplay regardless of whether you're at the point that you're about to flame or not, and it'll further improve how you play when you'd get to a point where you'd normally start throwing insults around. When you starting insulting others, often times your own mind shuts down completely, and if you think that your team mate is making silly plays beforehand, then it's only going to get worse as even if they ignore or mute you, their mind has also shut down, even a little bit.

With regards to league, wat i usually do is have youtube in the background, before i had my second monitor, i would just have some video playlist playing so i had some decent background noise to chill with. Now that i stream, i have music instead to try and deal with the jerks.
Another thing you could do is play norms with friend/find a dedicated duo to rank with u. if both of u can voice chat, not only will yall communicate better, then yall can bag on the jerks without wasting time typing out to them. And have a few laughs while doing so :3. 
Another thing to remember, though the mute feature is not an excuse for flamers to continue flaming, its ur first and best front of defense. as soon as someone starts something, mute their chat, mute their pings, mute their emotes. outta sight, outta mind. Then remember to report those who made ur game more annoying than it needed to be. And for the love of sugar, leave post game chat as soon as ur done reporting as nothing good comes from arguing in post chat. u can get reported/banned for being a jerk in post chat as well.
Remember, at the end of the day, league is a game you play to enjoy, not to increase ur blood pressure. people think their big bad dude on the net, so don't indulge them by getting angry. Only you can control how u act. 
p.s. if u do ever need another friend, i still have room on my list :3

4,I need help on self control...,Apostle of Light,NA, 249 ,2019-02-26T07:33:54.155+0000,2,"It can definitely be hard to not flame when you're frustrated about being behind or losing, but think about it this way: If you DON'T flame, you might actually come back and win (which is really what you want, right?). Especially in Iron-Gold elos, teams that are ahead (even WAY ahead) often make huge mistakes and give the losing team opportunities to close the gap. And despite the mixed opinions on the bounty system, it certainly makes comebacks a lot more attainable.
However, if you flame, none of you will be focused enough or mentally collected enough to take advantage of the mistakes the other team makes. So, if you feel like flaming, just think: ""What I really want most is to win, and there's still a chance of winning if I don't flame.""

Either the players in games are unevenly matched, or there is some outright toxicity and trolling.
 In my most recent lobby, our mid-laner decided he would like to go Amumu mid. I thought people were supposed to take ranked more seriously, but it seems there is just not enough punishment for toxic behavior. I understand that its possible to dodge, but why should I and everyone else be punished for the actions of another player. 
I enjoyed pre-season a lot, however now I find league unenjoyable; not because the game is bad, but the toxic environment that surrounds it. I don't know what has made it change this way in such a short time-frame.

(I know MMR doesn’t exist anymore but basically until you start getting grouped with Diamond+ players).Low Elo is full of Zed/Yasuo one tricks and people that want to make their off-meta pick the next big thing. I still see things like AD Janna top or Nidalee mid as a Plat 3 player all the time. It gets better the higher you go but people don’t start really taking games seriously until High Diamond.
The only thing you can really do is always try your best and try to work around the fact that they’ll probably lose lane but MAYBE offer something useful in teamfights and try to synergize somehow.But yeah it sucks and I wish people focused more on building viable team comps instead back when tank meta existed.

""We lost that team fight because poppy is a fucking inting jackass,"" unacceptable frustration.

3,Thoughts about frustration in game,EyesOfTheFox,NA, 105 ,2019-02-24T17:50:10.346+0000,0,"I believe that everyone on the planet has some form of mental health issue. This combined with a competitive atmosphere can breed all sorts of unintended interactions. You get people that only want to blame others and never look to themselves, which probably reflects their true to life nature to some extent. You get people that are afraid to do anything period so lack of initiative/lack of confidence causes them to lose and get shit on because they ""play safe"", probably like they do in real life. Everyone that plays this game thinks they are a master of everyone else's role including their own, so thinking that you are smart isn't the same as actually being smart, most often times they are dumb as shit. Then you have the people that complain about everything then try to get you to listen or follow them, even though their actions throughout the game shows that they are anything but a leader to be followed. No one playing this game (below a certain level) actually cares about the team aspect of the game. People don't like being told what to do. People don't like to have their actions questioned. We are not allowed to flame them or call them out on their bullshit so they just continue down the same path cause we gotta treat everyone like they are a wittle baby, wah. Even if you tell people ""don't fight, i'm pushing this wave first."" the very next thing they will do, is fight, die, then flame you for not being there, even though they clearly saw you weren't there, then still chose to engage or put themselves in a position to get engaged on, then flame you for not being there. Fucking, mental.
My advice don't say shit to anyone. Period. End of story. Unless you are actual friends with that person or know them.
A lot of the player base is too immature to actually take constructive criticism seriously so even if you are nice, I highly doubt that will change the way they respond to you.
This is just my thought on playing this game for 3 years. It's always the same story when it comes to in game flame.

"
5,Thoughts about frustration in game,EyesOfTheFox,NA, 105 ,2019-02-25T14:31:18.093+0000,1,"I think it's pretty accurate. Find one game in which you played that someone didn't go off, or do something stupid, or flame someone. The fact that you don't think everyone has some form of mental issue, depression, anxiety, less developed cerebral cortex, narcism, god complex, etc. Everyone has something hanging them up in their mind on some aspect of reality. That is a truth of the world.
My issue with all of this is that Riot cares more about words than they care about people's actual in game actions and it's often times the actions of people that cause others who normally wouldn't to go off the deep end to go off the deep end. Case in point me. I had a support feed 2 kills to the enemy team then get mad at me the marksmen (even thought it was solely his fault) and left lane and just started dicking around the map basically screwing the whole team over. I got so pissed, I ended up getting a 14 day ban for flaming his ass and I honestly feel this person deserved every word I said to them (normally I try to hold myself but for some reason this asshole set me off). My whole team agreed that this player was not doing the right thing, yet I get the ban for some words even though it was this other players actions that ruined the actual game. But because I use words I get punished. Yeah I used some aggressive words but I could also not escape that game due to no surrender, you can't report in the middle of a match and if you leave you get punished. So Riot forces you to stay in this game with this toxic person compounding the hatred the team has for this person and turning good people into bad people through sheer force of their own toxicity. Riot hardly ever actually takes a look at the events that caused the flame and just punish the flamer, continuing the cycle that allows people that actually ruin the game through their in game actions to continue to do so, while the people that actually care about the game are left to bite their lip and just deal with it. Fuck that.

Which isn't a mental health issue, no one's perfect. That's a statement above my pay grade, but I highly doubt that it's a universal truth that every single person ever in the world has a mental health issue.
Someone playing badly isn't an excuse to go off on them. You're wholly in charge of your emotional outlet, if you can't control yourself enough to not go off on someone in chat... that's a strictly you problem. The other person feeding kills and getting angry is bad, sure. But you don't have to flame them, it won't make them come back and help you'll just tilt them worse. If they were intentionally trolling, you can report them and they can get a ban. And they punish flamers so much more because it is significantly easier to determine bad chat than it is to differentiate between being bad and intentionally trolling. Better 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man be punished.

Eventually enemy team went for game closing baron, Graves dashed in and stole baron at the cost of his life one finally worth the death. We won that game. It was a tilting roller coaster to start, but i didn't lose hope and that baron steal ignited the spark in the team that was fading. Never give up, yeah some are unwinnable and others just need that extra bit of faith. That extra bit is the hardest though it entails carrying your bum off and no flaming owning your mistakes and doing what you gotta do to win. Show how bad you want it at the very end and you will win more games that look to be over.

When i asked they, why i have been banned permanently without any warning at all, they responded, that IFS (Instant Feedback System) had failed, because it didn't manage to process things properly. Instead of rightfully getting a Two Week Suspension after a toxic game, the system did not warn me, and issued me a permanent ban after the next game.

0,Rant: Off-role trolls.,Seen,NA, 30 ,2019-02-23T17:50:50.119+0000,1,"Came off a game where our mid laner was a support main and our support got autofilled mid. Our support asked if they could mid and our mid lane bans his hovered pick and went mid. Everything should be fine right? Nope. So after I picked an off-meta jg, our mid lane then decides to troll by switching to raka mid. Not because they're playing off meta, they explicitly said ""I got a better troll pick"". Despite me doing well for most of the game, 3/3 dragons, rift, not feeding up until mid game, they blame me instead of the 0-8 yorick and 0-8 brand because those champs are ""meta-picks"". And guess what, in the end they don't lose much from the loss because it wasn't their main role.
I think the role system is a decent idea as long as it is implemented correctly. The current system allows too much leeway for trolls to int games without hurting their real mmr. I say put all off-role people in one queue and all main role people in the others. This way even if troll exists for off-roles the other people on the team won't lose much either since they're playing their off roles as well.

He seemed pretty intent because it would pop up every time I declined it.

Am wondering if there would be available some kind of statistic about the frequency of a team talking (either All chat or team chat) and their win rate.

1.) Consider adding honor voting buttons for opponents as well as team players. This could add some credibility to use in ranking/LP gain given that you are less impacted by duo pairs that self vote regardless of performance. As an example, if a player gets 4 or more votes for play from all 10 players in match, there should be an LP bonus of some sort. Lots of potential nuances here and should be easy to impliment.
2.) With the general encouragement for players to try all roles in season 9, you need to enhance rune option limits from 6 to 10 to allow players to custom blend for all role champs rather than rely on third party add-ons, or scrambling rune adjustment pregame.
3.) I strongly suggest you reallocate some funding to report investigation department... the videos and merchandising are cool, but they aren't what is drawing players in, nor what is driving players away. Three matches this week where I am 10+ KDA early in match on SR and have players afk or just troll the match intentionally trying to throw. I record their names in an independent data base so I can dodge if paired with them, but they continuously crop up... clearly the ban threat to toxic and trolling players is not being taken seriously. The only thing that is apparent to being enforced is the verbal abuse (which is player solveable through mute).... but players who go intentionally troll and keep their mouth shut continue playing without consequence. I had one player 3 days ago admit pregame he was going to troll, then in game said he was going afk (went 2-23), so I reported him... then was paired with him the next day and again last night, and looking up his stats, he has had continuous matches in ranked where his KDA is 0.15, troll builds and he has no ban... this means there is inadequate funding allocated to enforcement support, or your punishment criterion needs adjustment. I suggest players this intentionally bad (through lack of skill, toxic attitude, or just trolling tendency) be suspended from ranked play and only be allowed to play ARAM, ARUF and Norms. Then report enforcement can apply a week/2-week long ban without really affecting the players ability to play the game and develop skills, but not at the expense of other ranked players (this is the root of elo hell).
Food for thought, please use it. The new ranking systems is well recognized as a legit effort to improve game play and peformance recognition, but there simply is inadequate means and consequence to non-performance outside verbal abuse.

0,Don't Blame The Support and the Jungler For Losing Your Game. Here's Why -,atorelle,NA, 102 ,2019-02-19T06:49:52.036+0000,4,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 
DON'T BLAME YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR JUNGLER FOR LOSING THE GAME.Unless:- They're feeding on purpose.- They're being toxic.- They unfulfilling for their role and don't know what to do in obvious situations.- They actually fuck up.
Still, some people are to blame in some situations, but by saying don't blame them is:Don't blame them for something that could be not controlled by THEM.E.g. You mispositioned and got killed.
Yes, we know all know that familiar feeling when you fuck up and you're losing lane pretty badly. No one wants to feel that way, but think about in times when you were winning hard and having a good time beating the absolute &#$%@ out of your lane, they probably felt the same. Just do better next game.
Now, I will admit i'm guilty of being incredibly mad and flaming my jungler a few times where he wasn't deserved. Whoever is that guy, I'm sorry dude. I shouldn't have done that, but we all make mistakes and you're human. And just because your jungler didn't help when you were being ganked that once time, doesn't mean he's trash. Think about the times when your jungler needed help and you didn't provide it because you just simply didn't notice, but he didn't scream in your face and call you terrible.
Ganking. We know that frustration when the enemy team's jungler is ganking you multiple times, and your own jungler doesn't gank you that much. We've all had that game where your jungler ganks the winning lane more than they gank your lane. Sometimes, try to think from the jungler's mindset. Yes, maybe it's not the best thing to do from the jungler depending on your situation, but sometimes there are situations where the jungler can't do anything. And I'm saying from how their champion is limited to an extent. For example, you have an Eve on your team and the enemy has a Xin Zhao. Xin Zhao proactively ganks you and invades your jungle. Eve is weak early game and her powerspike is mid game. She can't gank as effectively and you lose your matchup. (This is also pretty dependent on your matchup as well and how well you played)
I just wanna say thank you to all of the junglers that have dealt with some of us, and especially to those who gank, is lighthearted and doesn't go crazy. You guys must have a pretty tilting role since people tend to blame you for everything. Appreciation.
Now onto Support!I main Support, so some people might argue that I'm biased, but oh well.

Not being able to save you while you're being killedCheck in chat for Low mana pings or danger pings and mia pings.Are Summoner Spells intact?Did you misposition?Did you rush in not knowing where I was, where their jungler is, and not knowing that I'm not in range?Was I warding?Just because you wanted to go aggressive and sure you could kill them, doesn't mean your support has to follow up on everything that you do. 

Sometimes, you fuck up too. And as supports, we can see that, obviously. And we won't yell at you for doing this, doing that, not being better (Of course there is the toxic support exception). There are simply too many factors in a game that affects the outcome. Maybe your support just didn't have enough experience in the game? That's not their fault.There are too many examples I can list, but it would take me a day to write out everything. 
Please give me your thoughts, and try to post constructive criticism, and if you want me to add anything, say so and if deemed appropriate I will.

A note to all laners: I get that you are frustrated because you are being camped. I get it. I used to main top lane. But all you have to do is watch any jungle guide and they will tell you the same thing. Don't gank losing lanes unless it is perfectly set up, as in the enemy laner(s) is low on HP and you see the enemy jungler on the other side of the map. Honestly, my winrate when people get camped and actually know how to play from behind is probably around 95%. If you are getting camped, instead of screaming at your jungler for help, ward the jungle entrances and farm under tower. There are some times when I walk into my jungle and get jumped on by 3 people. No MIA pings, no rotating, nothing. But I don't yell at my laner for not helping me, I suck it up, respawn, and try to play from behind.

This is even more prevalent with the fact that unlike in pro play where you can't ban the same champions, you can in normal ranked draft, resulting in a normal net loss of bans overall without people just deciding to ignore them. I'm only bringing this up because I just got into a game where there was only a total of 4 actual bans because 2 were copies of champions they banned, and both of the teams just had two people that just decided not to ban.
For the reds out there,  there's a lot of problems with your guys ranked system as well as balancing in general atm, and I feel that you guys seem to just be completely ignoring us when we're pointing out why things just don't work and how you could be making the experience overall better. I know that the Kayle / Morgana rework is around the corner, but I really do feel you guys should be working on developing the rank system, because its negatively impacting a lot of people right now.

1,Is refusing to group considered greifing?,Jo0o,NA, 66 ,2019-02-18T16:53:30.694+0000,4,"I frequently play a split-push strategy. I'm at best a middling player in terms of micro-skill, so this sometimes results in me losing bad fights and dying in embarrassing fashion.
I get asked a lot of times to group, and whether or not I do so when asked depends on my read on the situation. A lot of the time, my team is wrong to ask me to group. For example, if I'm a decently-fed Yorick, I can take towers like few others and can 1v2, 1v3, etc. pretty efficiently, but in a team fight I'm a slow juggernaut with no gap closer and little utility. That doesn't, of course, mean I can guarantee the win. So if we lose after I refuse to group, I'm probably gonna have a few complainers, but I certainly wasn't trolling or griefing. 
Don't forget, the other four teammates have some responsibility in supporting the split push. Creating pressure at other points in the map is helpful, hard-engaging 4v5 and blaming me is not.

3,Is refusing to group considered greifing?,ChaosReyn,NA, 66 ,2019-02-18T16:54:29.879+0000,1,"There's still a difference between splitpushing and running it down.
I would say it comes down to 3 things: the game state, the champion, and the mindset.
If they're raging in chat and pretty much confirming that they're actively avoiding any attempt at working with the team while they afk farm and shove, it's technically griefing. If they're taking all the objectives while the teamfight is happening and overstay trying to finish something, it's arguably just a lack of communication or a bad judgment call that led to them believing they could stay as long as they did, and therefore not griefing.
if they're running it down top lane while your team is defending your mid inhib or nexus, it's probably griefing, as they're not really attempting to make an effort to save the game...the exception to this being the backdoor or base race of trying to take their base while you hold out...but honestly that one is a huge judgment call. If they're taking out the whole top lane while you're in a 4v5 fight over dragon, it's strategy more than griefing: even if you lose the dragon fight, top lane is now wide open for anyone to walk in and take inhib for the added pressure.
Lastly, and this one is by far the biggest judgment call, cause I'm guilty of this and promise I'm not griefing...but if you're a support splitpushing while your team fights, you're probably griefing. Like I said though, there are exceptions: sometimes the tower is low enough even the support can take it, then make it to the fight in time. Or sometimes, your team is diving and you decide to stop and focus the turret while your team runs 2 towers deep wondering why they're dying and not being healed. (never dive two deep, kids.) NOT committing mass suicide with a team full of people who forget towers hurt isn't griefing.

6,Is refusing to group considered greifing?,Elite4Runner,NA, 66 ,2019-02-18T17:48:53.205+0000,1,"Split pushing is a very good strategy, and someone isn't REQUIRED to group with their team. 
That said, split pushing is NOT ALWAYS THE BEST STRATEGY for any given situation. 
To answer your question though, .. not knowing when to split push is not griefing, and is not punishable. 
However, if someone does know that they should not be split pushing, and they do so anyways, .. that would be griefing, and will likely result in feeding, .. which could be punishable. 
The problem is, .. it is very difficult to prove that someone does or does not know that what they are doing is wrong. Honestly, the only way for this to be proven is if the person literally says in chat that they are intentionally throwing. Otherwise Riot would need to invest AN EXTREME amount of time in researching that player's habits, .. which they are not likely to do.  
Riot does not enforce that any one player on a team is the team leader that everyone must follow. 
Even if the whole team is asking that a single player join the rest of the team, that player is still allowed to make their own decision for how they play without being punished for it, as long as they are still trying to win the game.

0,Picks/Hovers/Bans,rujitra,NA, 30 ,2019-02-17T06:29:40.344+0000,9,"Many times nowadays, people complain about the current mechanics of League in that bans trump hovers, and pick order exists. While pick order likely can't be solved in ranked play, due to having to have some sort of objective and impartial method of deciding who picks first, the other issue is one I feel only makes logical sense.
Nobody forced Riot to make bans take priority over desired play champions. But, when you consider that there's 140+ champions in League, and that if someone doesn't want to play against or with one of those, the player who desired to play that champion can always play another... It only makes logical sense.
Does this open the door for trolling by banning hovered champions? Sure. Nobody denies that. Is the alternative (hovered champions take priority over being allowed to ban that champion) any better? Hell no. Not only are the exact same troll cases present, it opens up to a lack of team cohesion when you factor in that players could hover completely inappropriate champions for their role just to prevent them from being banned and thus letting the enemy team pick them.
One has to take priority over the other, and I think Riot has made the only logical decision. I'd love to see people discuss though, as I'm more than willing to admit there may be things I'm not considering.

It's illogical to hover before ban.  You can't make a team composition until you know the available champion pool. You don't know the available champion pool until after bans.
Curve ball:
Pick and ban are done at the same time. So first pick gets first ban as well. Then alternates teams after each pick/ban. 
Screw ball:
No bans. Duplicate picks allowed.

0,Specific Question,CurrySpice,NA, 28 ,2019-02-18T00:38:53.683+0000,2,"Hi guys, I just have a question for y'all regarding player behavior, specifically commenting on a teammate's play style.
If, in the case a teammate is clearly inting (evident through both the actions of the player and chat logs) or just generally trolling, is a player allowed to 1) point that out to a teammate and tell him to ignore it, 2) point that out in all chat so the bming from the other team will stop, and 3) tell the other players to stop trolling if they are tilted by the troll?
Just to put in what we already have, one of the recent responses on one of the WHY WAS ME BANNED CRI UNBAN PLS OR I TELL MOMMY posts I saw said this:

Riot has made it abundantly clear that asking for reports can be considered player harassment and that constantly doing it can derail the course of the game that you're supposed to be focusing on. 

Now though Hotaru ain't too great of a person (from personal experience XD), he's summed up well part of what I got from a nice and respectful Riot employee as well (THATS WHY U AINT AN EMPLOYEE HOTARU), when responding to one of my permabans; That commenting on a troll or inter's playstyle can, to an extent, be punishable. I can give the c logs if you want, but keep in mind that this isn't, at all, about any of my permabans, just to get information so that I can prevent future bans.
Mumbino said:

We do not want players to comment on other performances, arguing, and blame others because it only worse'ens the experience and game for others. 

I responded with some cri shit bout how going from 2 week to permaban because of comparing a troll draven to t1 is unreasonable.
He/she/they continue(s) 2019 folks:

We're not saying its wrong to point out when another player is breaking the rules of the game (by trolling/griefing/inting) because obviously they should be reported so we can investigate further. But we don't want players to continually be commenting on how they are playing bad or trolling is not ok because it turns the entire matches focus away from the game itself and more about that one player, causing the situation to only get worse.

I think this is a reasonable answer, that such comments can direct the focus away from the objective of winning the game and instead to the troll/inter. Then again, I personally don't think this should be punishable (then again again, I may be biased cuz I did this) rather I think there should be a system in place so that deaths, chat logs, and in game behavior per each game should determine the weight of a player's surrender vote, so that everyone could just get done with the troll and never see them again. Otherwise (like what happened with me) the troll would always vote no, prolonging the game, and prolonging the commenting on the troll, giving more fodder for punishment.
What do y'all think?
:)
EDIT:Just found this from Kei143 on a post of a player that got punished for extremely mild toxicity:

Let's have you understand the behavioral system a bit more. Think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat, your tension meter increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter.
Riot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter.
It is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some shit as well. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game.
Also, mass reports don't do anything extra compared to 1 report. Take it from the guy who wrote the system.

I think this is a pretty nice way to put it, but from what I saw in my case (again probable bias) my meter went up from like probably 95% (because of the preceding suspension) to 100% because I pointed out a troll (who possibly reported me for""verbal abuse""). What this means that even though by a small margin, comments regarding trolls may still be punishable.

1,Specific Question,TheUrbanKitsune,NA, 28 ,2019-02-18T00:48:25.025+0000,1,"
""is a player allowed to 1) point that out to a teammate and tell him to ignore it""

Maybe don't explicitly say something like ""X teammate is inting, just try your best to win."".Though you have good intent Riot seems to not like that type of language.Maybe something like, ""We may be at a disadvantage but just play it out."" or ""It's ok we can still win this.""It sends the same message and doesn't have the potential to further tilt the 'inting' teammate in the case they aren't actually INTENTIONALLY feeding and are just having a bad game or are of lower skill level.

""2) point that out in all chat so the bming from the other team will stop""

If enemy team is BM'ing just mute and report them. Don't risk being reported yourself.No need to tell the enemy team to report either, if it's an obvious int people will report them anyway, and reports don't stack according to Riot.

3) ""tell the other players to stop trolling if they are tilted by the troll?""

Again back to the first point. Just leave it vague, positive, and encouraging-- not accusing.
I'm no expert on these thing but seems like the best way to not get into trouble is to stay positive or stay quiet.People are going to troll and int games, best you can do is report after the game and not risk getting yourself in trouble trying to fight someone who obviously doesn't care about what happens to the game or their account.

Anyway, thanks for the advice, will be sure to use it in future games.
Also, do you know if muting everyone and just playing without receiving or giving comms at all (cept for maybe a few pings) punishable? Regardless of game mode as well? To me that seems to be the safest plan of action for each game nowadays.
"
3,Specific Question,TheUrbanKitsune,NA, 28 ,2019-02-18T00:59:06.379+0000,1,"Sure thing :p
And as far as I know, muting all is not punishable as pretty much everything you need to communicate in game can be done so with pings.That being said I usually don't mute anyone unless they give me a reason to (toxic, spamming, etc.) because people can still put valuable info in chat like calling out summoner spell timings or things like ""jg top side"", and I like reciprocating the sentiment when someone tells me I did a good job, but that's just me.If you get tilted super easy off what someone says it may be safest to just go ahead an /muteall from the start of the game.
Best of luck dude!

Regarding saying others are trolling or griefing, there is always a risk you are running when accusing people of trolling while they are actually tilted off the face of earth. The innocent people certainly don't want to be painted as a troll when they keep making bad plays. 
If they are really trolling, then they want a reaction from you. If they aren't trolling, your accusation can serve as harassment. So knowing those, why even point out the actions of others?

0,Ban Complaints,Tymo from DHL,EUW, 157 ,2019-02-16T20:41:24.301+0000,6,"Whenever I load up this page I see a lot of people posting discussions on how they got ''unfairly banned'' etc.
A tip to all of you that do that is to send a support ticket to Riot, explaining your situation and providing plausible evidence for your reasoning.If you wish to discuss your ban on here, I see nothing wrong with doing so; that can also help you see other people's perspective and maybe change yours regarding your so called ''unfair ban''. However, asking to get unbanned on this board will do absolutely nothing.
I recently received a 14-Day Suspension over a misunderstanding regarding a Zero Tolerance word. I chose to submit my ticket as soon as possible, explaining everything, providing all my chat logs etc.Within just 3 days, altogether I received 2 e-mails from an automated system and few e-mails from a member of staff that deals with Player Behaviour. My entire account was investigated, the situation was re-evaluated, I received an apology as well as an explanation on the situation.My ban was lifted very quickly and replaced with a 10-game chat restriction which was fair as in the chat logs I have lost my cool and decided to insult my team mates. The member of staff then wished me good luck and explained that ANYTHING I type in the chat is my responsibility regardless of the situation I am in.
To the people complaining about Riot or their Support team, there is no need to. This game is huge. It is virtually impossible for every single report to me manually investigated, that is why an automated system must exist, even if it does have its flaws.If the people complaining say the truth about their ''clean past'' then I see no reason for Riot to investigate your situation after you've submitted a ticket, however if you end up sending a ticket and your ban stays it just means you do not have a clean-past and have been toxic regularly, which would simply mean the punishment is fair, and you should endure it to learn your lesson.Some of the chat logs I've seen on here from people claiming they don't deserve a ban have very clearly contained toxic behaviour or negative attitude.
All I can say is re-evaluate how you communicate with your team, and work on your attitude towards each game as if you proceed with a negative attitude know, that you are affecting 9 other players in that game. To the people that have truly received a punishment over a misunderstanding, all you can do is submit a ticket and be patient. I've lost 3 days over a misunderstanding and Riot did care.
Other than that, have a nice day, and have fun in game ;)

2,Ban Complaints,Tymo from DHL,EUW, 157 ,2019-02-22T21:45:36.364+0000,1,"Yoo, apologies for a super late reply. My situation was that an allied player kept calling people the n word, so what I did; as you could imagine I was really annoyed because of him so I asked for a report on him in post-game lobby; pointing out he was using that word, but of course without thinking about it i wrote the word 3 times, of course not aimed at anybody just as an example etc. Someone in that game must've reported me for hate speech and the automated system caught the word I used which resulted in an instant 14-day suspension without any previous punishments or warnings. 
Prior to that game i was mildly toxic in my other recent games where I threw out soft insults when someone was being oblivious and just giving up.As soon as I received the suspension I sent out a support ticket: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new

Explaining the situation, soon I received an automated reply that explained why the ban was given and why the system thought I was being very negative. The automated response contained a link to request a human response instead. I was provided a short survey to fill out, after filling it out I gained the permission to respond to that automated email, in which I once again explained everything. A day or 2 after I received a human response saying the case would be past forward to a team that deals with these types of situations, and then the next day I got my ban lifted and replaced with a 10 game chat restriction which was based on my previous insults being thrown out; which was fair to be honest. 
The e-mail contained info on the whole procedure. How my account was investigated for any toxicity prior to that, any punishments etc. and based on that investigation the support team came to the conclusion that the suspension wasn't accurate. My honor level got lifted to level 1 and locked after the unban,  which made it much easier to get out of. As of present I am back on level 2 honor with rewards unlocked.So as long as your past is clean and your situation can be easily explained as a misunderstanding then you should have it removed otherwise it was deserved. After that encounter I had with the support team, they really do seem like they care about their players and if everything lines up with what the player says then they immediately deal with it.
I don't know if I helped, hopefully I did. Have a nice day.

Yes, and no. A single instance may not necessarily result in validating a report, but continuous rallying for reports can and will.

Would the better choice just to report the AFK after the game and hope your team mate and everyone else does as well without you asking?

Yeah - as PH45 said, the IFS only requires one report (more literally, any number of reports more than zero) to trigger a review, so getting more people to report a single person has no greater effect than if you alone reported them. Ultimately, there's no benefit to asking other people to report someone; best to just do it yourself and avoid risking a punishment down the line.

ofc, if one is trolling on purpose, go ahead and share your thoughts. But don't go too far.. be fair with him - if he just has a day off, try to cheer him or just make him feel a bit better.. instead of fanning the fire for good..

2,I need help,Umbral Regent,NA, 146 ,2019-02-16T22:26:24.142+0000,1,"Well, as someone who understands anger intimately and deals with anger issues daily, hopefully some of my advice will help.
General:
1) First and foremost, practice breathing exercises. Four seconds in, seven seconds out, repeat a few times as necessary. In particularly stressful situations, some well-paced breaths can provide enough catharsis to clear your head and get you back into playing form.
2) This is gonna be some generic advice, but have something on hand to vent with - squeeze a stress ball, punch a pillow, fuck around with a fidget spinner, or even shout obscenities at your monitor. Anything outside of the game to give you a release valve when stuff inside the game is working you up.
3) Take breaks often. Like the anger that is a byproduct of such, playtime is something that has to be managed. It's easy to let yourself get caught up in a positive feedback loop of losing, tilting, queuing up, losing, tilting, etc., so even if you don't want to end your play session on a loss, I'd wholeheartedly advise to take a break at the first sign of tilt. Personally, I take breaks roughly every 1-3 games.
Specific:
This advice is going to tread more along the lines of ""what works for some, not for others"", so take it with a grain of salt. My methods of stress relief have their merits, but they're far from say-all, end-all, be-all solutions.
4) Redirect your anger to something constructive. Anger, as I have learned, is seldom something that can be easily dissipated, much less recovered from, so I've found that one of the best ways of dealing with anger is to change its course. Rather than getting bent out of shape at my teammates for underperforming, I'll focus on setting an example and giving the enemy team hell. No sense in wasting good rage, y'know?
5) Have a friend/sibling/anyone to vent to. In a similar vein to No. 2, having a vent partner, just anyone who you can rant and rave at while the game is going on, can make a hell of a difference. It's one thing to diffuse your anger by shouting ""fuck, goddammit, sunovabitch"" at every grey screen, but there's much more catharsis to be found in being heard and having someone to understand why you're shouting.
6) And, lastly, if you're going to say something, think it, re-think it, and think again. If you really, absolutely must say something, make sure you say it in the best way you can. Rewriting or rethinking what you're going to say may take time, but being tactful can save you a lot of flak, and who knows? In the time it takes to figure out the best way to say it, you may find out that there's no reason to say it at all.
Hopefully some of these - hell, even one of these tidbits - help you to develop a better mentality, or at the least develop the skills to turn a harmful mentality into something productive. If you've any questions, feel free to ask.

If they make a rude comment, mute and report like you would if that feature didn't exist.
I personally like being able to see their masteries and do not want it to be optional. I will make sure to always be here to argue against it. I love it. Just don't be so insecure worrying about other people's expectations of you. It's just a video game. If you suck, it literally changes nothing about your life. (PS I suck)

0,"I'm suspended (understandably), but it's a little complicated",notabot1373,NA, 44 ,2019-02-15T18:45:36.151+0000,1,"I had a 1/26 draft game. This isn't possible without feeding, so I understand why I was suspended. I made my decision to throw the game with the support of 3 of the remaining 4 members of my team and sympathy from all vocal members of the enemy team.
After four of us had picked our champions, the only one left was our support. He picks Vladimir, which is questionable, but I figured it might not be too bad. He might be going a sorta damage-dealing, kill-stealing support like your average Lux or Pyke support; as I was playing top lane, I didn't really care that much. It's obnoxious and our adc will inevitably rage, but chat can be ignored. We load into the game, Vlad buys Doran's Ring - so not even pretending to be a support, then. He starts to walk bottom, then heads to the red buff I was leashing for our jungler. He autos a few times to pretend he's being helpful, then proceeds to steal the red buff. Nobody gets level two. At that point I was a little tilted; he'd shafted bottom and jungle both, but at least mid and top might be fine, right? Then he goes top and tells me to get out of my lane.
At the end of the day, this game is only a game, so I don't mind the fact that I'm suspended. Ruining the game of someone who tried to ruin the game for the rest of my team felt pretty good, especially considering everyone seemed to support what I was doing. I've been suspended for violations of the Summoner's Code, but I believe the Vladimir in question violated more of the tenets than I did;

Support Your Team: stealing red buff. Shafting bottom lane. Taking top lane when queued for support.
Facilitate Civil Discussion: denied doing anything wrong. Used abusive (or at least insulting) language.
Enjoy Yourself, but not at Anyone Else's Expense: self-explanatory, if you've read above. 
Build Relationships: ""League of Legends is a team game, and, as such, familiarity and rapport with the other competitors with whom you play is going to be a big part of your success."" Familiarity and rapport are not words I would associate with this particular player.
Lead by Example: what sort of leadership does this exemplify? What example does this set for new players?

The rest of the tenets could be argued with some extra effort, I suppose. And yes, I know my own violations; my suspension was well earned. Given the quality of the opponent I should have had, that was 26 more deaths than I should have had that particular game. Maybe someone can explain to me why action was not taken against this player.

I'd say you were suspended simply because the evidence against you was more easily provable by a robot than what your Vladimir did. I think what they did is undoubtedly shitty and rage-inducing, but two wrong turns doesn't necessarily put everyone in the right direction. I'd take some of what you posted here and submit a ticket and see where that leads you. It might not answer all or any of your questions, but you don't really lose anything from it either.

Maybe even prompt people to read specific stuff based on reports they are receiving.

I'm bronze I player trying to get better at the game and climb the ladder. Last 3 games i had a team like in the link. Our teamscore was 43 deaths to 5 kills... i only died 3 times, with the last two deaths way at the end when the enemy was fed as fuck and baron buffed. 
Now i'm not claming I had a huge impact on the game. My cs'ing was very bad early and i died once in lane aswell. I made my mistakes and i should learn from them. But even if i hadn't made mistakes and had godlike cs, there is no way i could've ever carried a game with 4 players having an average deaths of 10...
Yes you can report inting players but nothing ever comes of it. I mean what fun is there if you're improvement is always fluked by these sorts of games.

The way to climb is to win the games that ARE winnable, and to do that, you need to improve your own gameplay and put yourself in a position to carry. I recommend not playing Support if possible unless you're in a duo, since that generally puts you more at the mercy of your team's skills (or lack thereof). 
Play carry champs, work on your farming and fundamentals, and win the games that are winnable. You can easily hit 60%+ win rate doing this.

0,I need advice helping a toxic friend,Wiggily Bridge,NA, 88 ,2019-02-14T21:36:36.852+0000,1,"So I recently added a random account that added me, and in the voice chat, immediately realized it was someone I used to ranked years ago with. I had thought he quit league, because I never saw him on anymore, but it turns out he got banned typing something horrible. He was really bad about getting angry and screaming in voice chat, but he never used to type, and flame our allies. I stopped playing league ranked for a couple seasons, just finishing placements, and I think I'm kinda responsible for him raging in chat, because he couldn't complain to me about it, like usual. That being said though, he is even more toxic, and even when in voice chat, he will type in chat to take jabs at our jungler, which normally makes jungle ignore his lane while he feeds.  I'm not sure if I should continue to help him, or cut ties with him completely, because he really does ruin the game for me sometimes.  His highest rank was Plat, but he is hardcore losing/trolling stuck in silver 4, and is a support main. He abuses his adc every game in chat! I can't think of a way to help him,  besides maby, sitting down on voice chat, and talking to him to see what's going on, and trying to delicately tell him he is being toxic, and ruining our games. 
       As an example, he made our jungler DC from a game in  ranked, when he told him, he should have been swallowed.....  Kayn had tried to gank bottom, and was 3 0 at the time, but had engaged on the enemies under tower right as Warwick was coming in for a gank. Leading to a triple kill, and horrendous flame. He helped me mid, camping, and winning my lane(I was a Zoe vs a Yas 1 trick!). My friend constantly harasses him, constantly telling him he needs to set up a tent bot, when they are pushing under enemy tower 24/7. Thanks for reading, and any advice will help.

1,I need advice helping a toxic friend,Prandine,NA, 88 ,2019-02-14T21:56:03.295+0000,3,"There was this person in Wizard101 (an MMORPG) that I'd known for a long time who, after getting Open Chat (more freedom to say things than Text Chat and Menu Chat) was quite rude and disrespectful for a time (this was before I got Open Chat myself and still had Text Chat), at first to me (gloating about how it was fun to say things I couldn't see), but mostly to other random people (and yes, I did report him for it when he did act up).
Eventually I told him something along the lines of ""look, I've been keeping you on my list in light of our past friendship. But I warn you, continuing to behave the way you've been lately will result in me removing you from my list."" That in combination with him actually receiving a punishment (which he later admitted to me and even said that me reporting him was the right call when he asked if I did it) was enough of a wake-up call for him to apologize as it forced him to reevaluate his behavior. Since then I've never had any issues with him being disrespectful to me or others.
I would say to confront him on his behavior and warn him that if he keeps acting up that you will be forced to cut ties with him altogether. If you're lucky and he truly values your friendship he'll take that as a wake-up call to clean up his act before it's too late. It worked for me so it might work for you too.

2,I need advice helping a toxic friend,GatekeeperTDS,NA, 88 ,2019-02-14T21:44:40.355+0000,2,"You aren't responsible for making him act this way.

3,I need advice helping a toxic friend,Kei143,NA, 88 ,2019-02-14T21:53:54.607+0000,0,"Hmm ... one way I can think of is to use yourself as a sponge and deflect everything he has onto yourself. 
By that I mean to ask him to coach you, so you become better at LoL. So you duo with him (maybe as bot lane), and whenever something goes wrong, you ask him what could you have done better in an objective manner. Is it the positioning? Is the the trading? Is it the back timing? Is it the micro-side of the team fight? 
Ask him in game, and then get him to review the game with you after the match. So if there is anything that can't be explained in game, you defer the anger to the post game analysis. Also ask him in game what can be done next within the game to win the macro mid/late game. 
Through him being analytical, feeling important, and more objective focused, he may learn to stop being toxic. But that method puts a huge burden onto yourself. So if you are willing to take on that baton, then see if he'll do it. 
Personally, if I see someone who is toxic in my friend's list, I immediately unfriend and block them.

I feel like I am far above silver with mid lane Zoe, and have been climbing a lot but, If I duo bot with him we will get worse teammates because I'm bronze elo for ADC, and I feel like that will make him rage even more. I would also like to add that I did still win all 4 games I played with him, but most of them were agonizing solo carries because he would leave his ADC bot lane solo, and roam all around. The enemy ADC was superior to ours, so being 1v2 just meant he got slaughtered.

Apparently he had a close family member die (Not going to give out who in the family for privacy reasons.) He stopped flaming people in chat now, but still rages in voice chat, which is fine, and I can put up with that. I do still feel like he tilts easily, (one death caused by a teammate not reacting the way he wants, and he is full tilt), but that is something he just needs to improve upon, and we already talked about it. I had no idea he was having such a rough time in real life, but I adamantly told him if he kept dissing our teammates I would unfriend, and report him.

Humans can get frustrated, especially when they can't seem to solve something, that looks to be simple, but isn't. Climbing in league takes not only skill, but incredible patience with your teammates. That seems to be something a lot of rage posts about ranked really show is the player is tilted, and is probably sabotaging his own teammates, with tilted toxicity. What I do when I tilt, is I come on here, and make a post, or go play another game. Wait until you have recovered your mindset then get back to some normal draft to build your confidence. No one is immune to tilt, Faker, and even Phreak can tilt. Now whether he voices his frustration in voice chat vs actually chatting to his teammates is what really separates him from being toxic. Keep it in the voice chat, or yell out loud, don't type frustrated remarks to your teamates, and win more games! I've had games where I keep getting 4 man ganked mid I'm 0 4 0 10 minutes into the game, but only behind 10 CS. Now could I have rage quit, and afked, blaming my bot lane for never calling mia? Yea!, but instead I rode out the game like a man, and ended up something like 8 6 6 at the end of the game with a victory.

4 Remakes (excluded in count)

= 100 (+4) Games since Jan 24th, or the start of Season9.
Total of 2813.183 Minutes of play time (or 46 Hrs 53 mins & 11 seconds)
Didn't count the amount of honors or team honors progress I got. 
Is the 100 games or 20 days a coincidence ? Who knows.
I'm surprised that I actually play more than I thought.

I usually don't mind as much for AFK / feeders / troll, but this time I want to do something about it. What should I do? Send a ticket? 
This person tilted the entire team and ruined the game for everybody (enemy team as well - easy win free LP but certainly boring).

If they were in your game and haven't played much in that role, it would mean that their main is a much higher rank, so you can probably count on their map awareness, understanding of macro and positioning in team fights.
My personal example; I'm a silver2 support, but my mid rank is bronze3. While I may not know the specific lane matchups,  I can still ward effectively and can still tell others of where the enemy jungler is.

Even before the new matchmaking, lots of people were getting autofilled and feeding. It's possible they are trying even less now because there is less consequence to their main rank, but Kei43 makes a good point about higher elo players in lower ranking off-roles at least understanding the game well. My personal opinion is that the current state of the game has tilted the community out of their minds so any early setbacks are more likely to result in insane tilt and feeding.

Write a ticket to player support at https://support.riotgames.com
 and let them know someone else has been using you account. 
Make sure you get them to check for the unauthorized entry instead of the use of scripts, cos they have to first prove the unauthorized entry before they do anything about the scripts.

0,Should a Player who disconnects and returns be punished?,battlenix,NA, 54 ,2019-02-10T06:36:11.649+0000,1,"So recently, I've become more aware of an issue that comes with playing ranked. Now, as we all know, going afk during a disconnect means that it is automatically counted as a loss, receive a D-, and no opportunity to be honored, now while this is all fair. I do wish to pose the question. Should I player be punished if they disconnect, come back, and help their team to win the game. This was brought to my attention in around november, I was playing a ranked game, when all of a sudden my PC decided to shut down. No reason. No warning. My PC was charging for crying out loud. There was no indication that it should ever stop working. I got back on about seven minutes later, anxious to do my part for the team, of which I feel like I did. Excited to see how close I was to bronze promos, I checked my ladder ranking. It went down. Along with my hopes of making my last minute climb to silver after a fiveish game (six including that one) winstreak ""That's not fair,"" I thought. But alas, I figured it was okay. Today, three months later, something similar happened, my PC tabbed out, letting me know that I needed to charge my PC. I plugged my PC in, it made the sound to indicate it was charging, then, about a minute later, without warning, it shut down. Aware of the consequences, I still got back on and continued to finish the game, and helped to turn the game around from a pretty bad scenerio. It's bronze. That stuff can happen. Here's the thing. My team, this time, AGREED that I should get points. They thought I had done enough of my part to be rewarded. Now am I saying that all people who disconnect and come back should be rewarded? I think so, after all if they come back it clearly wasnt of their own volition that they left in the first place. They're STILL trying to do their best for the team. One can go 0/14 on accident and not be punished, but if one has a three second power outage? Something COMPLETELY outside of their control? They come back in and make the game winning play? Doesn't matter. There goes their promos. No matter what their kill count is at the end of the game, no matter how many objectives or how much CS they got. Doesn't matter.
Sometimes life just happens. I don't think its fair to punish the people who are trying to do their best. As much as it sucks to have disconnects on your team, it sucks just as much to be the one who disconnects and is now shut out from any type of reward. Some may argue that it definitely shouldnt happen in all games, say someone gets back three seconds before the enemies' nexus explodes. While I disagree with that, as they're still trying just as hard as the person who went 0 and 14. I DO have an alternative suggestion, maybe there should be a CS point, or a KDA requirement to get credit. I don't want to say an amount of time back in the game because that just doesnt make sense. If the total time required is lets say 20 minutes, theyre in for 17, have to relaunch, come back in and the game is 3 seconds from being over, even if you took an inhib you don't get credit. TIME is not the same as CONTRIBUTION. Riots whole thing is try your best, and if you win, you get the rewards. But I did my best, I was able to help fix the mess that was created, and I received fruitless results

But the way I see it there's no way to tell if they're even winning the game or not. Most games where people go AFK are lost. It also may encourage them to actually come back and fight it out if they do rage. It's not a ""free win"" they still have to do their part.

0,New player having trouble with trolls,wesley38,NA, 24 ,2019-02-08T15:46:05.244+0000,1,"Hey everyone, I started playing a few weeks ago because my husband loves the game and since I like video games as well (first person shooters) I thought it might be a fun thing for us to do together. He was really excited and we have been having a great time and he has been showing me the ropes since he’s played quite a lot and is something like level 130. 
I’ll come home and play a few games with him each night so I’m about a level 23 now. I’ve been trying a few characters and settled on learning Jinx as I think she’s a lot of fun. I’m not perfect but I think I picked up the game up pretty well. I learn from my mistakes and have drastically reduced my deaths and manage to always hold my lane and take towers. I’m now working on my farming and team fights. I’m pretty squishy so I’m trying to balance doing damage without dying since people seem to go for me first.
The problem I’m having is trolls. Most of the time things are okay but every once and a while someone is just absolutely awful. I’m trying to not let it rub me the wrong way but it’s hard.
For instance, last night I was paired on a team where everyone was level 130+ and I was 23. I held my lane, and even got a tower. My support wasn’t great, he kept running off to jungle and to mid for some reason so I was basically on my own. I think my final was something like 5/2/4. So not great but not terrible.
My non-existent support then proceeds to say that I didn’t get enough damage and am ass and everyone then rags on me...even though they didn’t hold their towers and we’re running all over chasing champions. I’m brand new and I even know not to do that.
It really got to me. The last thing I want is to come home from a hard day of work to play a game and get flamed. If it’s the enemy team who cares but my own team? I’m about a minute away from quitting or just sticking to bot games. I don’t know what to do anymore.
I’m super positive and always stick up for others when I see them getting trolled and I don’t get upset when we lose because it’s an opportunity to learn but no one ever sticks up for me, they just stay silent in the chat.

1,New player having trouble with trolls,Inquisitor Dante,EUW, 24 ,2019-02-09T03:36:48.328+0000,2,"Hello wesley.
The problem with open communities is just that, they are open, so you will get the occasional bad apple.
I've read through all other replies to this thread and seen several points that should had been addressed ignored, so while I've been away from the forums since my failed romance with Ahri, I'll try to write you something to help you find your north on this matter. 
You've to understand that, you'll be teamed with people with anger issues, hormonal issues, poor manners.. teenagers, for short. 
There are a few things that you can do to handle this fact, 

Mute people when they start insulting or belittling you or others. Never be afraid of muting your own teammates when they begin direspecting others or losing their temper, both your chances of winning and your experience in the game will improve when you do so.


Add people that you enjoyed playing with to your friend's list. That Sona that stuck with you through thick and thin, gave you advice and honored you after the game? The sooner she makes it to your friend's list, the better.


Queue with a friend. Invite that aforementioned Sona, and any other players you meet and that you would like to play with again. You don't need to make a full team every game, even having a single friend in your team can make the occasional nine years old that much more bearable.

The best you can do to handle unhelpful, childish, and or uncouth teammates is simply to use the mute function, try to work around them, and leave a report on their name after the game.
Never listen to them, or give in to their provocations.
You can't fix that they decided to take it out on you when the cat mistook their bed for the litter box, but that doesn't mean that you've to bear with it.
Have fun, and as a new ADC, never forget.
It's always the supports fault. 
W. M. Dante

Unfortunately trolls will happen from time to time, and while they are definitely frustrating to deal with it's best to not let them get you you too much. If I may make a suggestion you could try taking a break from SR and try playing some of the others modes such as TT and the FGMs. Not everyone in LoL is a troll or jerk, you just gotta know where to look for them.

9,New player having trouble with trolls,Kei143,NA, 24 ,2019-02-08T20:09:21.092+0000,1,"Let's have you understand that being high level doesn't automatically make you good at the game. 
Someone can be lvl1 and actually be a pro, as accounts are free to make. 
We also need to correct your terminology as being bad doesn't necessarily mean they are trolling. At the same time, just because they use a different strategy (in this case, roam and pressure mid) doesn't necessarily mean they are a troll. 
Whether it was an effective strategy to roam and pressure mid is another discussion and changes from game to game, but you need to recognize that there are other methods to play the game  and you might need to change your strategy on the fly  and adapt to the situation. 
The game is not only played with one strategy,  the more experience you accumulate,  the better you'll become in identifying how to adapt. Sometimes it's ok to concede tower, sometimes it's ok for you to die at one side of the map and your team gets stuff on the other side of the map. 
Bottom line, never stop asking yourself on how to improve your macro strategy and don't blame others for not following the strategy you are used to.

11,New player having trouble with trolls,ChrilleN,NA, 24 ,2019-02-08T16:23:59.761+0000,-1,"Okay, so what I think happened is that you were doing very well in your early leveled games and the system Riot has in place thought that you were a smurf account. Which means you're doing significantly better than most other players but sadly, you have to deal with other smurfs (who most of the time get banned for toxicity it seemed to me) or moments like these. You have a great outlook on the game and you definitely didn't do badly, they're just dinks who want to blame someone for their problems, but the only thing you can really do is Mute and Report them. From my experience once you report a player you won't match with them again, so I hope that helps a bit.
Most of the community aren't dinks, I promise. It's just those that are, are the vocal minority. Good luck in your leveling and I wish you the best if you play ranked at level 30!

I find it hard to learn when people are constantly harassing you for any small mistake, especially when the only way to get better is to make those mistakes early on. I got very lucky in that my husband was able to show me the ropes and give me tips. I think if I was to have just started and only used the League tutorial I would be miles behind.

0,Do people in normals ever get punished for verbal abuse?,Krinu,NA, 119 ,2019-02-08T08:11:56.013+0000,1,"Title.
I play exclusively normals, because I'm not a fan of the stress ranked adds. It feels like the game has gone from decent fun to a shitfest of toxicity, no matter who's winning or losing. I report people for it when it's egregious - my last match had someone in it who spent the whole time calling us trash, dogshit, garbage, along with the usual laundry list of expletives.
I have never seen any indication that these people are punished. Is the answer to mute pings, emotes, team chat, and play that way? Or do we just laugh at the rules and start calling each other the rudest names we can think of?
I'm about one more bad teammate away from giving this game up, because this is supposed to be fun... but I've had more awful teammates in the last few months than good ones, and it's getting harder to resist the urge to just make everyone else as miserable as I've been.

When ganking, it's important to do it because it's a favorable decision; not because they want you to. Mistakes people often make is not warding, not keeping track of the enemy jungler, and not respecting matchups. Sometimes it's a bad matchup and the BEST thing they can do is farm and die as little as possible. Even if the matchup is favorable for your teammate, but they've died three times, leave them alone. Put your attention elsewhere. Often, the enemy laner will get cocky and/or impatient and that's when you can punish them.

Reason I ask is that on the day that account seems to be created which was on 11/9/2018 you apparently played 17 games. That does seem a little suspicious to me. Its not impossible that you did play those games, but on no other day on your match history do you even come close to this many games played.
If this is a shared account and was given to you, please note that account buying and or sharing is against the rules as well and can lead to an immediate 2 week suspension or permaban.
But as to your question the best way to contest this would be with a support ticket as no one on the boards have access to the information needed to help you.

It requires .NET Framework 4.6.1. When it's running, it will pop itself into the Windows system tray. When you switch focus to a League game client, it will block the ENTER key for you; when you switch out (Alt+Tab, etc.) it will unblock the key so you can use it normally.
I recommend adding it to your startup list so it launches itself automatically when you boot up Windows.

Other than that though I see too often in many games the jungler getting flamed for no reason , because top/mid especially can't take responsibility for their own poor map awareness/ability to ward.Ganking losing lanes usually doesn't work , and I'm not talking about 0-1 down 15 cs losing lane im talking the 0-2 down 45 cs lane with no summs.If solo laners just respected their enemy a little bit more they might win more games.

Junglers have the broadest set of responsibilities. That makes them the perfect scapegoat because for most things that can go wrong the jungler could theoretically be to blame.

Jungler has to make a lot of decisions, rather than just play mechanically well, and thus it is easier to criticize due to subjectiveness. But in my opinion, its just an easy target. Usually laners get tilted after ganks, so they want someone to blame, and its the enemy jungle who pissed em off, so they blame their jungle for not pissing the enemy off as much lol.

I main top. I literally cannot walk past my tower because if I do, enemy jungler comes to gank me. It does not matter what I try to do in lane, enemy jungler still camps me for 15 minutes straight. Wards do nothing. If the enemy jungler decides to dive, I die. I might get a kill, but it does not matter. He comes again and again until I'm completely out of the game, I lose my tower, and enemy team can do whatever they want.
What does my jungler do in these situations?AFK. Literally afking 1 meter away from me. Every single game. 
No matter how behind I am in those games, I still take Herald, SOLO. Because my jungler does not give a single fuck about any objectives. I'm going full Hashinshin right now, but I wish Riot put impassable walls around the entire jungle for 15 minutes. Because this is disgusting.

You're mid, 1/0/1 with 145 CS @ 14min, already destroyed tower and you're pushing so you can roam bot since they need it...
 has a full jungle and both Dragon and Rift Herald are up. Ward coverage is great, supplemented by that control ward you bought solely to help your jungle. Bot is being pushed in and he decides to come mid and stand around waiting to demolish the wave, doing his best to last hit every creep that wasn't a caster 1-shotted by orb.
You ignore it, because you know if you mention that you can't farm jungle like him and he could be farming there, he'll start deliberately following you around to do nothing but steal creeps. (as always)
Scenario 2:
You're . You're having a bit of a tough lane phase and are behind by 20 CS, but your team's jungle  comes by at just the right time to pick off 10% HP  and . A little annoyed that he swooped in just to take both kills but ultimately relieved of enemy kill pressure, you see the enemy jungle at top and decide to clear up the wave and take a turret plate before returning to complete your .
 takes it upon himself to smite your cannon minion and steal the rest of your wave with his superior early game waveclear, then leaves running right past dragon with full health. Again, you ignore it, because doing anything but sitting down and shutting up is going to get him to try even harder to tilt you. Of course, now that he has a leg up he has no more reason to come bot, and your enemy's lead continues to grow.
What are you even supposed to do in these situations? It happens almost every game. The only time it isn't an issue is when I'm support, because I'm not the one trying to farm. Am I supposed to just get  as an ADC, knowing that the jungler in a pretty vast majority of games takes whatever they want when it suits them, but isn't actually there to help?

Had a Nasus in my last game (ranked). He won lane against a vayne (great!) but for the rest of the game refused to listen to pings/chat and decided to farm ALL my camps plus any empty lanes away from any action just to get to 1000 stacks. This resulted in multiple lost teamfights near enemy base because we thought Nasus was coming but he suddenly detours into enemy jungle to farm blue buff.
There really needs to be some kind of punishment for this kind of behavior. He obviously wasn't trying to win and had some other goal in mind.

Winning the game is what we all want, so rather than assume a players position is incorrect, be humble enough to assume you misinterpreted their position.

When you have someone telling others to kill themselves, dropping that c-bomb and that no one likes them, yet you end up getting chat restricted for defending yourself. It just seems to me like the toxicity is at an all time high with this new season. Wondering everyone's thoughts on this.
"
1,Toxic community,FF or QQ,NA, 108 ,2019-02-04T12:04:32.703+0000,2,"Yep.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and so too is toxicity.  It's all equal, or none of it is.  And it's for these reasons that we need to remove toxicity reports from the game.  Only report for intentional feeding, afks, cheaters and scripters.  
I've actually quite league until the tribunal fixes this.  They banned an old account of mine from the first season of league.  For flaming in 2% of my matches, I lost 300 days of game time, all my champs, 100's of dollars in skins, and my entire friends list.  It doesn't seem equal.  So they won't see me on the rift again until some massive reform is done.

2,Toxic community,TruWuju,NA, 108 ,2019-02-04T00:01:39.802+0000,1,"Defending yourself means as they curses you and demeans you. Put head phones in (mute them) and don't defend yourself. And then his duo will flame you for it. So you then mute him and almost 50% of your team you cant talk to. And then they just spam ping you for the reason of the game and report you anyways because they are together. So you mute their pings. And you still get banned or chat restricted. Because they are going to tell the enemy team that you are calling them names and you won't know because you can't see it. That's a wonderful system to help stop the community from being toxic. wouldn't you say riot????

More often than not, we aren't talking about someone defending themselves, but retaliating. People tend to conflate the two. Defending yourself means muting the source of toxicity, whereas fighting back and arguing is something completely different.

0,hey,Vlad To Kill You,EUNE, 167 ,2019-02-03T05:18:21.012+0000,1,"So basically when i got 3 months ago permanent banned i got the permanent ban kind for just trying to make someone who was trolling to start and act to play normal... , there is something i still no understand while my support case is all time closed without an answer , i asked very clearly what was such toxic in a matter of toxicity behaviour to receive 130 years permanent ban , because i wasn't having knowdledge that saying oh i go support and send a ticket is already considered toxicity the thingh is that most of people use this to scarry people to perform normal or to play serious and take the game in serious , so i am punished for doing that??? ... .About some phrases i sayd in game 2 , i have the right to state yes someone flamed ,yes someone stoped to play serious and open the mid , yes someone keeped insult me , then 1 guy asked for my jungle lane and lied me that he was smurf and he wants to be jungler and stuffs like this ... , i am not quit sure how i insulted 7 people ,as i am sure anyone would have something personal with me would send a report , even if i didn't play average or as good i can every time ... , they would send me a report cause people are like this , if they no like you ,bam let's go i report you for that and that and that ,who cares if you insult me or not , i let riot report you for something else and mark you as extremly toxic for kinda nothing... it's really reforming people , if 3 months seems to be nothing in my reform road ,that i have no right for case analys ,phrase by phrase i asked really nice and present all the arguments i could possible show that there is nothing that toxic into my behaviour that should receive permanent ban,because past chat restrictions were for criticism ,word:""report"",and kinda no swearing at all , and there is nothing which can't change if i woulded know that doing that is ban able and in somehow is flaggered as negativity , why ??? , is very simple because is a psyhical tactics which acts against people who want to ruin games , if someone get's scarry or concerned of consequences he eventually stop from doing them... , a case like this i seen very often always using the same tactics landed in chances of making someone to stop or not pushing that behaviour further ... so who knowed that this is marked as toxicity ??? cause i tryed to have ranked experience chill and good after a day of s12it , i can deal with the losses even with 5 losses a day when i got permanent banned , but yeah stay chill and calm 5 games while you already got 2 different games one with 2 guys who troll and another with 2 more ,then going again in 1 game and getting again 2 trollers and 4 flamers in total cause 4 of them flamed me for nothing while 2 of them maded stuffs in purpouse trying to get me angry or to not give us the advantage of winning the game
Then the second thingh if i got reported for smth what have that to do with my chat logs , because game 2 is clearly nothing negative in it , because zed was likely leaving the mid lane and just asked him open mid ?? , like was supposing to sound zed you open mid ??? , it's really weird you get banned for nothing after you worked hard to reform , 3 months between the 14 days ban and i got honor lv 1 checkpoint 1 , then i got permanent banned after the worst day of the days i could play on EUNE , and i considered myself that i wasn't quitly chill regarding the times i had to play in and the people i had to face... ,secondly 2 months after my lv 170 account got permanent banned for playing daily a couple of games , i got to start again on a new account but this time i got no longer any punishments time of 2 months or more ... , so can you proof me what's going on over here , i mean how i can be triggered as the toxic guy who must be removed from the game while others troll the game ,leave you to play 1 vs 2 , leave you to defend nexus alone , you do your best while the jungle decides to not even help you giving you red , and more than this i was playing normaly and wanted to win ... , but instead i was like hited with indifference by support and jungler... , on top of these i wasn't getting the end of season ranked rewards and i droped from gold 1 to gold 3 because i took the game more chill , i am really not willing to understand how the ban system finded to punish me regarding 7 people reports i got in last 2 games ... ,cause i suppouse if someone flames you after you doing your best it's definetly going to write or send reports against you,so he can rid of you for doing almost nothing that wrong... 
There are 7 reports from 20 games.... weird... , negative and abusive behaviour and the ticket is automaticaly answered by a bot while i asked for human answer the guy who had to answer not even come to share the answer it just closed my ticket , this is how it have to be done yes??
Players have reported you 7 times in the past 20 games for negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games, griefing your fellow players, and generally being difficult to play with over a large number of matches and teammates.

0,Why is honor reset at all?,TheLegendaddy,NA, 113 ,2019-02-02T11:15:50.482+0000,1,"I feel like honor should be a persistent number that only changes when your behavior has affected it. Especially if matchmaking factors in honor level (which I hope it does). 
As of right now having it reset basically utilizes it as a gimmick to draw players in for a grind for rewards which is the wrong idea entirely. The goal should be to reach level 5 and continue to reap the best rewards over players who are toxic and get no extras, along with getting matched with players with overall better attitudes.
Honor should be more about the matching of players who are similar attitudes and not fake nice till you get the honor skins.

I think you have some pretty big misconceptions about the Honor system. It's not meant to match you with like-minded players - if that were the case, I would've never encountered any toxicity in my Ranked climb last year, since I was Honor Level 5 since mid-August.
The Honor System has no bearing on matchmaking. It's simply there to reward sportsmanlike behavior with ambient and periodic rewards.

Well good to know it’s another completely wasted opp on riots part. I thot it’d have weight on matchmaking. 

It wouldn't, and here's why:
If Honor had any bearing on matchmaking, placing high-Honor Level players with other high-Honor Level players, that would mean, conversely, low-Honor Level players would be pitted alongside other low-Honor Level players. Essentially, putting Honorable players with other Honorable players, and Dishonorable players with other Dishonorable players.
In other words, a Prisoner's Island. Something which Riot has stated that they're against.

I figure since they’re such a big company it’d feel less like free game quality, ah well

Free game quality for some. Imagine misbehaving enough to get your first Chat Restriction, and then being dropped into a cesspit of toxicity for every match then-on. Would you want to reform if that happened?

Actually, the prisoner island would follow the same mentality they’re employing with honor reset every season.

It really wouldn't. The Prisoner's Island mentality is ""take anyone who misbehaves and throw them off into their own toxic queue so that the people who follow the rules won't ever have to deal with their toxicity"", regardless of whether or not a punished player was actually toxic, or just having an awful day.
The mentality of resetting Honor every season is less about cordoning off sections of the playerbase, and giving Honorable players more opportunities to be rewarded for their sportsmanlike behavior. It wouldn't make much sense for Honor to have exclusive skins like Grey Warwick or Medieval Twitch as rewards for hitting HL5 if the Honor Level didn't reset at the start of the season.

Which is “prove yourself” “earn again” so if they get chat restricted for being an a hole....why not have to earn ur honor to get back into a queue where players first reaction is not to sabotage you or the current game

Because, as I mentioned, and as Riot Gromp and Riot Simurgh said in the Nexus article, lumping all of the toxic players together in their own queue disincentivizes reform. They're not gonna want to earn their Honor back if in order to do so, they had to play through months upon months of matches where people are actively sabotaging them.
Would you be willing to sit through match after match after match, day after day after day, month after month, of people trolling, flaming, intentionally feeding, and everything else under the sun, just to get at least one decent match in?

12,Why is honor reset at all?,FF or QQ,NA, 113 ,2019-02-02T11:54:32.518+0000,-2,"I agree, this trend of forcing players to regrind their accounts is present in all forms with Riot.  From banning account over words, to working off punishments.  Chat restrictions, low priority Q's, whatever they can to reset the grind.  They want players to earn chests, keys, and essence more slowly.  As a veteran player, I used to earn about 20k Influence Points before the Blue Essence patch a month.  Which means about 3 champions, I had all but 12 champions earned and two dozen skins collected over the years.  
I said a few words in a game, and got a 5 game chat restriction.  I was like ""whow, better calm down, we're on the way to being banned now."", so I did my best to ignore salty players.  Since that's their game, they'll get you to cuss them out and both of you get reported.   So, for a week or two I said nothing, then another game I slipped up and let them tilt me.  10 game chat restriction. 
 I was like; ""Yeah, that last restriction didn't de-escalate as quickly as I expected, but sure."" then went on to say nothing for about a month.  Slipped up again and flamed a jungle for feeding my lane then telling me to play better.  25 game restriction.  The larger the penalty, the longer it takes to de-escalate.  I pretty much knew I was screwed then, because you'll get reported for next to nothing and the instant feedback system is broken.  Keep in mind, how subjective the idea of de-escalation is.  The main argument for it is; ""It's Riots game, they can consider it whatever they please."" which I find to be a rather weak argument.  I like to believe as summoners, this game is equally ours as theirs.
But, I soldiered on, more tilted than ever.  I wanted to talk more after the restrictions since I felt the renewed freedom wash over me.  Which, some harmless trash talk led to a 14-day suspension.  Which tilted me beyond belief.  For two weeks I festered, playing a smurf account.  Finally when I returned, a train pile-up of toxic hit me, each game a player would provoke me.  I tried for weeks to not get banned, but eventually it just happened.  And it all started with a 5 game chat restriction, a account with over 100 days of game time, countless skins, champions, all of that, gone.  A domino effect of toxicity.  After several years, since the beta, the account was lost season 7.  Lasted five seasons.
I'm going to start taking a survey in each match, ask who is playing on a second account because another one is currently suffering a punishment of some sort.  Then after I have a good medium, range, area, etc etc, compare it to the total player base and see if it's a large number.

When it was updated, they tied it into the crafting system to where you'd get keys at a more consistent rate. Then they later put it on ranked rewards, as a way to get people to have better attitudes. So when you don't have high enough honor (from being punished) they could keep better track on where rewards go.
Plus it can be abused in ways, like there's people out there that troll and give honors such as ""tilt proof"" when they say someone is tilted, so trying to tie it to match making wouldn't be the greatest idea, since various people's could be inaccurate in that way.

Even if you are saving everyone the trouble of you possibly saying something that will get you banned and trying to cool off.  This also allows the team to surrender at that point and it only takes 4 votes as well as ends the game instantly.  
However, on the other hand you can deny surrender until 20 minutes in holding everyone hostage for at least 6-9 which is the same thing as a leaving penalty even though you had 4 votes to surrender?  A Riot Employee pointed out that if you leave you ruin the game for 9 people.  I'm pointing out that 4 people from that game are now tilted and more toxic because they were just held against their will in a game because of one troll that is inting.  Good luck with those rules I do not understand the logic behind a 4 to 1 vote not being a surrender after 20 minutes in game.  That's a bigger penalty than the leaver because you can't walk away and cool off.  You're stuck in a cage with a troll while the enemy laughs on the chat.  GG guys.

ApothNinja, it's hard to not say anything, nice or not, when you're stuck in a game down 35 kills and can't farm or move out of base but because a feeding Nunu wants to keep inting you have to sit and watch him run directly into their turret mid for another 9 minutes because riot doesn't understand that trolls exist in the world.

It executes minions below a certain health level grants kill gold to the closest ally and gives a small amount of regen too. You will most likely see tank supports taking this item. They can go in to last hit a cannon minion and protect the adc from excessive poke damage while the adc gets all the benefits as if they killed the minion themselves.
Also on a side note,Don't ask for reports in chat. The system only needs 1 report to review the game and issue punishments. Extra reports on the same player really doesn't do anything, only 1 is needed. Excessively calling out for reports can be a form of harassment and can earn you a punishment if you spam it or do it often. I would be extremely careful about that.

Losing an ADC as support is much easier to deal with, selling your support item to CS and get straight damage/tank can surprise the laners when your jungler ganks, and if you feed you're still a support so you'll be useful even if your KDA is garbage.
When you're ADC and you lose a support, the enemy laners will hunt you down and kill you until you're useless. Either your jungler ganks and spends half their time bot, or they let you die endlessly. If you're against a tank support (or Karma/Zilean) there's pretty much nothing you can do to live/cs. If you're against a carry support or supporty support (eg. Brand/Annie or  Nami/Soraka) you can possibly get them into a cocky turret dive or get kills through ganks. You should have an EXP lead too, so you should tell your jungler to gank when you ping you're nearly level 6. You will still have an advantage 2v2.
If you're extremely lucky, you picked Varus and you can diddle people regardless. CSing is still risky. Ezreal is not as good, having to get out of the way of minions to hit your Q almost guarantees you lose a trade or you're too far and you lose cs instead.
No matter how you play you are at a disadvantage, you just have to think it out, you're Diamond so you can come up with better solutions than I can. I just play bot lane 90% of the time (support) and know how it goes, but don't have the mechanics or memory to check map, pay attention to ability CDs, know how long I have to make a wave hit tower, are 3 inhibs > baron buff? etc...
Either way, rare enough it shouldn't effect your overall rank over the course of the season. Might happen like 5 more times, oh well. Only truly matters when ranked rewards come out amirite.

0,Leaving during a game/punishment,Dracogenes,NA, 249 ,2019-02-01T05:22:51.459+0000,1,"I feel as if RIOT needs to increase the punishment for leaving a game, I have played numerous games in the past where one or more people will leave at any point in the game due to rage, anger and frustration either with themselves or with others, and I never feel as though they are getting punished enough for leaver buster to do anything. One of my more recent games was my last straw, I had a taric afk before the 5min mark because he felt as though his adc would not follow up, he completely disconnected from the game (so he better get punished). Then within the next 8mins my wukong fully disconnects (also better be recieving a punishment) and then my 2 other teammates sat on the step. 
I am a person who believes in never surrendering, that is because I have experienced many comebacks, some allowed me to win, and some caused me to lose. I know from experience that random things can happen and turn the game around. Part of my philosophy of not surrendering is that if I am gonna take the time to play a game, I am gonna make sure, that I play the game, not quit after 15 or 20 mins. My friends do not always like that I always say no to a surrender, but they also admit that it has gotten them some wins that they did not believe they would get. 
If anyone is gonna prepare to play a game, then play the game, its not hard to do, so I do wish even if someone just sits on the fountain and gives up, they should also be punished and because I feel that leaverbuster does not always punish those people or not well enough, I feel like if some reports others for leaving/afk, they should also receive an instant feedback report like other reports do. 
Some people have the idea that well if they leave then they can just start another one, and I understand that, sometimes I feel that way, but just because one or more people are having a bad game and not enjoying it, does not mean that they can speak for everyone. Thye only times I do not have fun, is when someone leaves and even then, I can sometimes still make it fun in other ways, I have won numerous 4v5,3v5,2v5 and ONE 1v5 (game crashed and I was the only one able to reconnect after 10 mins). And its things like those past games, even if we win because of a fluke, we still win, and last time I checked winning, is more fun, then losing.

If you afk or leave mid game, not only can you not do anthing on league for the rest of the game until the game is done (unless you have another account), and then deal with the time delay of the punishment (which there should be)? Like it seems ridiculous to me that people get away with this, personally, I feel that people leaving and going afk is one of if not the biggest issue that players have and experience and RIOT should have a harsher punishment for it.

The jungler flames his bot lane for feeding instead of looking for what mistakes he did and how he could have played better to stop bot from feeding.With the jungler example: The jungler usually flames his bot because he wants to shift the blame to somebody else and feel better. Or He can’t accept the fact that he made a mistake or is wrong so he lashes out at somebody else (in this example it is his bot lane).
These types of people don’t really change that much and will always stay in the same negative loop, so it’s best to just ignore them (like muting and reporting him after the game) instead of arguing to try and make them accept their faults. You can help Riot show the toxic person the door (by reporting), but don’t get to a flame war or huge argument that gets both of you shoved out of the door (you get banned and so does the toxic person).

So I see ""report x"" all the time over players whom the messenger thinks cost them the game.

Thankfully, their report rallying has no real effect. As the IFS only takes into account how many reports are filed greater than a value of 0 - so if there's 1-9 reports, the game is reviewed. If there's 0, the game isn't reviewed.

How do they get sorted out?

As far as I understand it, the IFS looks at a player's chat logs and uses context clues to figure out, holistically, whether or not the player broke the rules, was negative, or flamed someone throughout a game. It's difficult to accurately describe without an example log, but the IFS is pretty good at catching negative and toxic behaviors.
If a review finds no examples of misbehavior in the reported players' chat, the report is flagged as invalid and discarded. If the review does find misbehavior, the report is flagged as valid, and the player is appropriately punished - whether by reducing Honor progress for that match or with a mainline punishment.

Yeah. Lots of players like to report someone for ""inting"" or ""trolling"" when the person simply had a bad game.
Some of those players have a wrong view of what inting and trolling is, some of them don't know when a player is actually inting or trolling, and some of them just like to report someone that didn't play well in an attempt to get them punished.

If you report for trolling the report is 99% thrown in the trash with no further steps. Only if the guy ran down mid with 6 tears or something like this will lead to a punishment.
If you report for chat related things, the system probably first probably checks for ZT words, then some kind of ML stuff is used on it, or at least that is what i think Tantram once said, and punishes you accordingly.
Being reported nine times or once in one game, does not matter. (It only matter if you get reported 327846387264+ times and it flags you for a manual review where the Rito bots, who has no idea how the game works support checks your games.

Either the persons connection is so bad that they didn't load or couldn't play, basically making them useless for the rest of the game since there is no real way you can fix your connection if its so bad you can't move or join; OR you got someone you, for some unknown reason, queued up for a game, accepted queue, chose character and runes and everything, then just left while game was loading and didn't come back, making it so you have someone who just through from the start, but at least if you play well and are lucky you can comeback form that or at least have a close game, right? The problem is, while one is involuntary and one is completely by choice and blatant, they both ruin the experience for the team mates that were forced to play with them, especially when, more often then not, the person who is afked for 10-15 minutes is queued with at least one other person that just says ""they will be back"" and refuses the remake request. It is so frustrating to deal with, and even if it is their connection, even while thinking that they can't help it, you still just feel disappointed and angry that you are stuck in this situation because of someone else's choices or circumstances.
Is there anything we can do about this? It happens so often that I almost want to call for harsh punishments for players who do not participate (could be checked through total clicks, map movement, CS or some other stat that is already tracked) in the early 10-ish minutes of the game, whether it is ping related or just them being rude to the rest of their team, but I know that is unfair to the ping players who can;t control the bad internet.

In general if you have a bad connection you get punished in some way.If you afk a lot of game the system auto report you, even if you come back, there is a treshold of 10-15 minutes that you get auto reported.If you have high ping and your performance affect amtches, you are more % to lose, in ranked the system put you in a ELO that you dont deserve (skills and ability) meaning that this dude, when he is playing, could easily stomp the enemy.Generally you have statistically that having a bad player with good connection is similar to a good player with bad connection. In the end the % to win a game still depends on you in the long run (if you play 100 games).

2,Does Leaverbuster get you permanently banned?,MordridtheBlack,NA, 81 ,2019-01-29T02:55:29.011+0000,1,"The leaver buster system is simple, but also complex.
It is actually 2 systems in one. The first system is a, grace buffer.
This buffer, builds up over matches you play and don't leave. It likely has a cap of 100.
The second part is where the leaver buster actually comes into play.
When you leave a match still in progress, it consumes your ""grace"" entirely.
Then if you continue to leave, after <x amount of times> the system puts you into a low priority queue because you were leaving to many games.
You then often have about 5 leaver busters, where you are forced to wait in the 20min low priority queue before the normal match queue kicks in. After you finish those 5 matches (hopefully without leaving again), the leaver busters are removed.

1,Question about bans/suspensions,Jungle since 40s,EUNE, 65 ,2019-01-29T15:57:45.646+0000,1,"Riot resets the history of punishments for players who show reform and stop displaying toxicity and bad behavior in the games. There is no estimated time for this reset but the best is to not risk your account doing things that can get you banned no matter how much time has passed. You can't know if your punishment history has been ""cleared"", riot can't let you know that but you do know is that you are on a thin ice since you got banned (it's the last warning and if you choose to dismiss it and continue the toxic behavior you receive perma) and no matter how much time has passed you should not risk it under any circumstances.Whether or not your punishment history will be cleared is up to you only. By playing frequent games and showing good and possitive behavior, your punishment history will probably be cleared. But you must keep in mind that: game inactivity does not clear your punishment history. For example if you leave your account inactive for much time without playing games, this willl not clear your account. You need to show reform and good behavior by playing games frequently.

If the behavior was negative but not enough to punish based on one game, the game will be stored and referenced the next time the player is validly reported. These games will fall off with a couple months of active play on average, after which they cannot result in a punishment.

0,Toxic Story -17 LP,S8 IS VERY SUCC,NA, 44 ,2019-01-27T07:55:24.292+0000,2,"Simplified Story:
We had a mid-laner who was going to play Sylas and warned everyone that he'd troll if we banned his pick. The enemy team bannedSylas and he proceeded to troll as he picked Xin Zhao. Our Jungler picked Ahri hoping that Xin Zhao would take up the Jungle role. Hedeclined. This led to a loss obviously. The enemy Jax was able to do anything, mid-lane still lost, I fed hard bot-lane due to literally nojungle (not a stereotype this time). Ahri decided to troll with Xin Zhao saying things like, ""I know how to troll, kid,"" and flaming me cuz Iplayed like shit since I was discouraged and tired. 
(I'm apparently more toxic then these people for calling them out on things nEGAtively).
Late-Night, boring story (Please don't read):
Part 1:There was once a courageous man, we'll call him ""General."" He was going to play the <NEW> champ mid-lane (New champs shouldn't be allowed in ranked for at least 2 weeks). He exclaimed that if we banned his champ, he'd troll. Jokingly, I said i'd ban, but obviously I didn't, However, the enemy team banned his pick, and you could sense his anger as his veins popped out of his head. 
Part 2:General's tilt was rising, higher than ever before. This is where he exclaimed, ""okay i troll go now bye."" (His language was far too superior that I couldn't understand. I'm lucky enough to be able to read it). This is when he locked in Xin Zhao. He obviously wasn't messing around now, Xin Zhao is a well known counter-pick to Lux, he calculated this before we even started the game. Unfortunately for General, our ACTUAL Jungler forfeited his position to try to get General to switch to Jungle. 
He declined. . .
Part 3:Our Jungler, who has transitioned into Mid-Lane?-- has picked Ahri, we'll call him Manes. Because of Xin Zhao's pick, and the locked-in Ahri, he decided that he'd duo lane with him. He, like Xin Zhao, became a troll. The countdown till the game starts was almost over . .
3,2,1
Conclusion:Manes duo-laned mid-lane with General, and said, ""I know how to troll too kid.""

Don't do that, it serves no purpose. If you have a problem with a player, don't act as a vigilante. Report them and let the system take care of it. You screaming at them or calling them out for whatever reason won't solve anything. It will just exacerbate the problem.

Okay why do I have to get games like these. Why do I have to lose LP from childish things like this.

Statistically speaking, your enemies have a higer chance of finding themselves in that situation. They have 5 random players, whereas you only have 4. You're filling the last spot.

League of Legends. Two opposing teams of five players. The objective is to destroy the enemy team's nexus. 
Individuality and the solo experience. Getting Gold for items. Getting Items for Power. Getting Power for Control. 
Team Work. The coming together of several individuals to form a team. That team of individuals working together to fulfill the objective. The objective, to destroy the enemy nexus. 
Mistakes.  An accidental action or miscalculation. An action being a movement attack or ability.
Research and preparation. Know the variables. Variables being champion stats and mechanics. Item stats. Gold income sources. Buffs and nerfs. 
Conclusion. Play for the solo experience when necessary. Use teamwork to obtain the main objective. Avoid mistakes. Know the variables  be prepared.
- Abnormalities & Obstacles - 
The loss of teamwork due to:

Misunderstanding - Usually the result of misinterpreting communication from a teammate.

Friendly Fire - The intentional degrading of a teammate causing hostility within the team.

Lack of Participation - Unwillingness to obtain objective.

Insanity - Objective is switched around with an arbitrary one. ""Trolling"" ""Inting""

Beyond that, we were also told that they wouldn't update us on the progress or whether or not the experiment was a success. No matter which way the experiment went, we won't know until the hypothetical scenario occurs where a new one starts, which, frankly, would be unlikely.
Would that there could be better news - or, news for it at all - but as far as we're concerned, even if the results came back conclusively positive, I'm doubtful they would have extended the trial to others/an increased sample or done much further in that line of testing.

Does the honor reset to a lower level once the new season starts or is this a false-positive by Riot bots?

As soon as Season 9 Started and the patch hit, my honor level dropped to Honor Lvl 2, stage 1.

That's intended. Honor Level resets at the beginning of every Ranked Season. Honor Levels 3-5 get dropped to Honor Level 2 with checkpoints based on their overall Honor level - so, HL 2 to 2:0, HL 3 to 2:1, HL 4 to 2:2, and HL 5 to 2:3.

Like what did I do now Rito!?

Start/continue the climb, as everyone else does.

Yeah I agree, I see people flaming their adcs for attacking tanks in gold-plat elo occasionally. Some tips talking about how adc's are supposed to position to hit the safest target at the time and only go in for the dive whenever it is absolutely safe to do so(think someone with low cd CC/damage dying, key engage tools being blown, or a carry being out of position). Honestly, various positioning tips would be nice since it's a skill that some people never learn or realize exists.

Then to have them cuss you, call you trash, and just berate you, as if that will help you play better. I've played so many other games and never seen as much hate as in this one. It is just a game.

In this case, there are expectations that the other players set for you and when you fail to meet them, well... That happens. Riot has given you plenty of tools to better yourself before you go in and waste everyone else's time with shoddy mechanics and poor decision making. Suck it up and realize that it is part of the game - just like at a job, where you are expected to meet a minimum set of requirements on the daily. If you fail to meet those expectations, there will be consequences.

0,New account-naming conventions needed to prevent hashcodes,Austin Covello,NA, 69 ,2019-01-26T05:45:56.423+0000,1,"Riot, if you see an account with a suffix or prefix like this: kHgRe or some sort of alternating lowercase or uppercase lettering (and possible numbering, as well) when it doesn't spell out an actual word, you need to start banning these accounts proactively, and prohibit future accounts from using those types of alternating cases.  These are bot accounts.  I've had my games spoiled plenty of times by botting players on Twisted Treeline, and invariably, they use these types of hashcodes at the end or beginning of their names.  I imagine it has something to do with how the scripts are coded and how they interface with the game.  Of course, I report such bots, but they keep popping up, anyway.

Started out normally enough, the Trundle flashed under tower for first blood and got himself killed too. W/e got a stack. Then the Anivia jungle would proc Predator run up to my lane  and wall behind me, then Trundle pillar, then Anivia Stun. Over.. and over. I was able to escape the first few times but it was really annoying and I died twice more.
They went to allchat and started saying that they'd throw the match, just stay away from me so they can farm kills off me. Sure enough Anivia leaves dragon/baron/etc. uncontested to chase me through the jungle with Trundle. Was able to turn the tables once or twice but they'd just buy resistances the next time.
Then the Tahm Kench asked me why I was feeding, called me terrible, and I should stop being bad. I tell him they're literally waiting for me to leave base and if I stay I'll get an afk ban so I split pushed for about a wave (illaoi clears in about two slaps) and would run somewhere else hopefully before they could reach me.
I catch Sylas out in a bush (the same Sylas tahm called bs op but whatever) and killed him pretty quickly with the Caitlyn snipe to finish him off, then Anivia and Trundle leaped out to kill me, but lo and behold the Caitlyn helps me and we get them and the Ornn too.
Game ended with a win and I was.. fine, even after suffering 40+ minutes of hide-and-seek (and kench's flaming) but then the Anivia and Trundle go in aftergame chat with ""report illaoi for feeding"" ""report the feeder"" and tahm kench with ""I gotchu."" Ended with a little bit less damage than the Caitlyn and was forced to hide under tower (not that it mattered, Trundle would just tank it) split pushed the empty lanes, kept two of them busy chasing me instead of trying to win or afking like they wanted me too,  but sure yeah I fcking fed.
Sometimes I just.. really want to uninstall league so I don't have deal with that crap anymore, I get enough of it day to day.

As for the ""current honor"" I do not personally see a reason to share it as I don't see a reason to be able to flash your rank in a game.

I have a very little time and get home at around 11~ PM, leaving me with 1-2 hours to play.League is the only thing keeps me happy when I get home and I'd rather not waste time with someone who clearly doesn't want me there and only has the intention of ruining other people's games.

I'm of course inclined to give the obligatory shpiel about not leaving - since, y'know, dishonorable, can't report if you're not there, etc., etc. - but, at the end of the day, it's really on you to weigh the ramifications (loss applied, inability to report, potential LeaverBuster penalty) against the short-term benefits (not having to deal with a match with trolls/feeders).
So, just my two cents, don't sign up for a match you can't play.

Quitting is not always the solution, unless you don't find the game fun anymore. Simply being angry/upset is natural for a game like League where there are frustrating elements in the game. It's almost inevitable. 
Sometimes you just have to control your emotions, and don't let the frustration ruin your enjoyment of the game.

It doesn't mean that they don't enjoy playing the game, it just means something happened that they think fucks with the competition, comparable to a bad ref call in a sports game, maybe Riot gave one too many buffs to a champion and they're pissed at how broken they are. Another example could be how your team isn't going to be too happy with you if you get a flag called on you in football for offsides on the play your team got an interception and it gets called back, someone could get angry at you for not doing your job in league.

Think about the scenario where you are last pick, you are thinking about the best champ to play, after you decided your champ, you know that if you lock in you only have 10 seconds to change your runes. 
It takes 3 seconds to load the runes window, each rune you click takes 1.5 seconds to visually show you clicked it. Sometimes you can't click on what you want because the hovered text from the rune blocks below covers your selection and have to wait 3 seconds before that text disappears. Sometimes you are changing your mind and have to change runes and those secondary rune's FIFO system is messing you up. 
It also takes 3 seconds to save the runes and close the window so you can lock in, and then now you are left with 10 seconds to change the remaining runes and summoner spells.
I ate 3 queue dodges in the past month because I couldn't save and close the runes in time to lock in my champ.
That thumping sound doesn't do much as I've turned down the sounds of LoL, since I need to keep my environment quiet (baby sleeping when I get time to play) and the visuals don't mean much when your eyes are focused on clicking runes as fast as you can, but the VFXs are not updating as fast as it should.

I'm pretty new so I don't know which one is right. One of my friends says I have to play more aggressive (since I have a passive play style) and the other one is saying that my play style is fine and he's just mad that he overextended on his gank and wants to blame me. (Since the one who says I should play more aggressive is a jungler. the one who says I should play passive is the ADC) Here is my play style: I play Blitzcrank and I only push when I land a hook or when the other team has less health or level than me. If they they are hiding behind a tower, then I back off. If both teams have the same health and same everything I never go in until I land the hook. I never push against top laners unless I have the support of a top laner myself. If they have more people than us, I will say to my ADC that we should retreat until help comes. (Unless they are all weaker than us)  I'm open to criticism and tell me who is right in this situation. I genuinely don't know who is right.

But if you have the chance to play aggressive, it tends to give you more options.Thus why I am a big fan of Leona as support. And engage supports in general.As well as a lot of mages that I can use (mid main after all) to harass the enemy team out of lane or make it unsafe for them to CS.

8,What's better as a support; a passive play style or a more aggressive one?,LuciferDraco,NA, 10 ,2019-01-21T02:16:18.492+0000,2,"Neither is correct. But they also not wrong.
You have to find a balance between offensive and defensive, Understand when you have the freedom to be aggressive and when you are forced into a passive stance. This usually changes many times during the course of the laning phase, Power spikes/Cooldowns/items/ganks ect...
There's no right or wrong when it comes to how Aggressive / Passive someone should be there are too many variables involved for any one answer to always be the correct one. Who your teammates are heavily impacts this and you'll have to gauge this on a per game basis. (basically are they trash players who wont followup? or are they amazing and have the capacity to react to your engages quickly).
Which stance are you more suited to? Personally i find i win more games when i'm aggressive and take action and so, I tend to try to play champions who align with this. I main wukong for this reason who has the ability to go full on aggro and force engages with a flash ulti. Others might not win games with this style of play so they try to play passive champions like Soraka or Janna who excel at stopping the opponents aggression. 
If you think blitzcrank's hooks are fun, Try playing Pyke... So fun.
tl:dr = There are times to be passive and there are times to be aggressive. Master the art of knowing when to swap styles and you'll find success.

You need to make the enemy think you are playing aggressively by always looking for the Q angle but only using that Q when you are very very certain you will hit it. While your Q is on CD you are basically a nothing champion so you want to have it available most time and you need to fake hooks etc to make enemy miss CS or back off when you actually have no intention of hooking. Also the best way to play the lane is to wait for level 2 or 3 run/flash on the enemy ADC and E them then while they are knocked up walk slightly backwards and then hook. Worst case you get a flash out the ADC and your hooking life got way easier, best case you got a kill.Blitz is an ALL-In champion so you want to have Q-E and Aftershock all up when you make a move.

The main point is that you and your adc should play the same. (He being aggressive while you are in the back will result in his death, with probably 0 result, and doing the other way around too.) I do not know how passive you are, but you might be able to zone a bit when your hook is up (not zoning out of XP, but at least some lasthits.)
But in the end, there is no better tactic, I mean there is, but not this general, it would depend on matchup, enemy/your jungler etc... But all In all, both tactics are ok, if you do it properly.

You need to look at your team's champs and the enemy's and play to your strengths.
 Also if you can, look at how your partner and enemy moves, those will tell you how you should play.

This is one of the reasons why I don't play ranked, so as not to damage other's standings. While I try my best, I like to call myself the ""Eternal Noob"" because no matter how much I read, or scour boards, I don't seem to improve at a rate above glacial. I've met some really nice people in game, but I've also met some who get extremely worked up over their teammates performance, and nothing I say seems to help. Then I end up freaking out more, and the experience is terrible for everyone. I don't want to stop playing the game, but I also don't want to get yelled at or make other people upset. Is there anything I can do to cool down situations like these?

For instance: ""yo wtf we called for dragon 30 seconds ago and you stayed stop lane with no lane opponent?"", just be like ""my bad, thought I could clear my waves faster"" or ""you're right, but I thought my lane opponent was still here""
or ""why did you have to cc the enemy away from us when we could have killed them?"", just respond with ""sorry, i thought my spell was going to kill them for us""
maybe they are saying ""can you stop inting?"", defuse with ""i'm actually trying but i'm having a rough game. who do you want me to focus?""
i respond to angry teammates with stuff like that and it calms them down quite a bit, and it's so much better than escalating with them. 
However, if they are flaming you ""holy fuck you are terrible"" or ""uninstall this game you piece of shit"", ignore and mute, do not respond.

B. Completely ignore and learn on your own
The Day toxicity ceases to exist in competitive environments is the day strategy and intelligence dies. Ik the snowflakes here won’t like that but hey that’s how it goes you need to accept your environment for what it is and adjust to it because people are being toxic for a reason. When you are consistently making the same mistakes then they will be consistently brought up by someone who knows better or thinks they do.

Like disciplining a child, you put them in a corner and don't even show them any hint of attention until they start behaving. Same principle with League, you have to remember the main demographic attracted to this game. 
They're looking for someone to blame, looking for a reaction, for you to retaliate and give them attention. They'll then feed off that, use it as some convoluted justification and they'll be even more toxic for even more of a reaction. If you don't respond, and they continue, they make themselves look like asshats and player behaviour systems will pick them up. As a general rule they'll give up, and those that don't, will be punished harder.

If you've exhausted your options in trying to lighten the situation, sometimes it's best to just let things happen and/or mute them.
While it sucks to say, there's never going to be a way to always get a teammate to relax. The best you can do as a fellow player is not exacerbate the situation and keep things as civil as possible. Plus you won't run the risk of being reported yourself for trying to fight fire with gasoline.

But anyways we all popped off hard and moved on to our next games, but I actually ended up playing against them while the duo bot and the solo kayn were on the same team. I went top again but even though I popped off my team lost the game pretty hard. But I didn’t care that we lost because I had so much fun playing against the people I just played with lol. After that game we made a premade of all 4 of us, one of my friends did join us to be our midlane for a few games because I forgot to turn off the auto join thing.

I play for fun which means ill pick certain champions even if they are out of meta or im not good at them because i have fun while playing them. However to a lot of people thats #1 sin. The problem is that toxic people are never removed or punished from the game.
My tip is to do 2 things.

/mute all. Usually this is the main Method that most people recommend when people start tilting at you in a game because it instantly silences them and gives you peace of mind.

Report them. Give a detailed (but not too long explanation of their antics) In my exp reports without comment are usually filtered so they are never looked at while reports with texts seem (no stats to back this up) have a higher amount of response rates (this is only when the individual is being extremely toxic.

However, in ranked, it IS a ""#1 sin"" if you take your yolo bs right into our ranked games, where we're trying to climb and improve on our actual main champions and someone like you goes 'YEAH LETS PLAY SHACO FOR THE FIRST TIME FEED 12 TIMES BUT AT LEAST I'M HAVING FUN'. Sure, you may not SAY anything toxic, but toxicity is not just SAYING things, it's also INTENTION, and how selfish your behaviour is, and for this reason, you will get flamed, because toxicity incites toxicity.
In general, if you want to be treated with respect and kindly, do so yourself first, so in this game, if you go into ranked, this applies not just with what you say but also with what you play, and yes, to some extend, how you play. If you start yolo full int invading 1v5, people can get a bit triggered.
And sure, there's those who flame incessantly for no apparent reason other than that they're tilted themselves, but I think we all need to take a breather and look a bit more objectively as to  why people are being ""toxic"".
For the record, I /mute all every game and every game I don't usually say more than 2 things, something along the lines of 'wp'  and 'push'.

I finally took the dive mid 2016 and hopped in to pvp regularly. I was still afraid to disappoint teammates but then I finally had the thought, I can mute them. 
I know sometimes you wanna know what’s going on in chat but if it’s at the cost of your fun in the game or worse mental health you should mute teammates/enemies. I’m not saying do it at the beginning of the match but as soon as you see that negative chat towards you that makes you feel flustered just slap that mute on them. I promise you it’ll minimize the stress. And you’ll be able to play better or at least focus. I hope there are helpful tips in there. Good luck in future games and have fun.

Everyone who has their honor reset starts at level 2, with a checkpoint headstart for every honor level that was earned above 2 from the previous season.

You don't have to do this but it sometimes helps, especially when the other player is not toxic at heart but just frustrated maybe because in their last 3 games they had someone do exactly that to them.Keeping a cool head in the worst of situations can be quite beneficial to you as well, one day you will have kids (or not if you don't want to no judgement just go along for the example) and you will have to live in the same house as them, and they will do stupid senseless things, you can see toxic players as training for that or other situations where you need to coexist with non-cooperative people.

Although I don't think that was likely the case in this specific instance, there's another similar behavior that I'd like to point out. The person who thinks their plan is good and will try harder and harder to implement it, despite the mounting evidence that it's not working. They're not even feeding out of frustration.

If I was in your scenario, that's plenty of time. But you aren't me and you don't use chat like how I do.
Ultimately, it depends on your own behavior. If you are using your chat to still harass and insult others (even minorly), then you are cutting your chances pretty short.
One thing you want to make sure that you are using chat with 100% positivity as you mentioned. You can submit a ticket to https://support.riotgames.com
 and ask them whether you've validly reported in your recent games. If so, can they provide chatlogs. If not, you are on good track to get your rewards back.

0,"I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?",ItsJasonBourne,NA, 37 ,2019-01-14T09:17:31.685+0000,1,"Hello everyone on the Player Behavior board.  I would like to tell you my story about how I changed my perspective on playing as a toxic player with the hopes that you too can be saved.
A long time ago on a rift that has long since changed, I learned how to play this game and took a liking to the top lane. I learned all the meta top lane toons and even some that weren't part of the meta at that time.  I was fresh to the world of competitive league of legends. I played with a collective of friends that were still leveling and some that like myself were fresh level 30 accounts (season 2/3 time frame).  In my early days, when i was still learning, i knew that flaming and griefing was a thing but instead combated it with ""if im doing something wrong, can you tell me how to improve it?"" to which i more often than not was greeted with something to the effect of ""oh, sorry didnt realize you were new.""   As season 3 chugged along into season 4 and LoL get even more popular and started EXPLODING is when i noticed an even larger influx of people who had the sole intention of griefing.  After a while it became a constant bombardment of toxic players and that was when i changed.  I went from ""bright eyed kid wanting to play a game"" to ""a grizzled vet who it was their way or the highway.""  in season 5 or 6 i had a bit of a spell where my addiciton to WoW took over and i found myself playing less and less lol and more and more wow.  I had the symptoms of addiction to league though coursing through me that took me over again and i found myself playing a variation of support/adc in almost every game. I grew to love the role and found some success with it. However my toxicity was at an all time high since its not only a matter of keeping myself alive and farming, but having to worry about a support as well or ADC if im supporting.  Game after game i tried starting off positive with the, ""dang, well get them next time."" or calling for a jungle/mid gank for our next try.  Most of the time my lane partner would take a death or two.  It wasnt quite the end of the game but if it was against certain characters it was almost a death sentence.  After switching to primarily a support role i figured it would be better.   HOLY MOSES WAS I WRONG OR WHAT?  If a ward died and i didnt replace it in .01 seconds, i was flamed,   ADC playing too aggro?  KYS support. nothing i could do was right.   I started flaming after what was mostly the season 6/7 time frame.   I had come to be consumed with addiction to the game and was never happy while playing it.  Then i got my first chat ban.   10 games.     was pretty pissed about it and then i became a mine field of teemo shrooms coupled with Ezreal's ""you belong in a museum"" taunt.   but i bit my tongue and suffered 10 games.   At this point i started playing more normal and less Ranked to try and untilt and just get back into the right mindset for ranked.   then it happened.... i got paired with a premade and these kids were rallying and working solely for the sake of infuriating whoever they played with.   Constant bombardment of pings, 2 of them feeding intentionally running into enemy base i lost it and melted down on a nuclear level.   I subsequentially got a 25 game ban.   At that point i said to hell with it, the craving to play league was there but i had been burned by it enough to know it wasnt healthy.   I stopped   cold turkey.  It was so unbelievably rough.  All my friends would only want to play league and nothing else.  I decided to go play playstation with my irl friends who i hadnt hung out with because they werent playing league, I went out and became more social and hung out in bars just to find some interesting conversation. I did everything but play league.  When i took a moment to realize, that in the grand scheme of things, a game like league shouldnt consume you and that theres a perfectly good life to live outside of the rift. If you do bad, it sucks yes, but as long as you were your best you or learned from your mistakes or it made you a better player in some respect that was when you could truly enjoy league.    Next time you get stuck with a Teemo support building full mage or an ADC morgana, dont let it bother you.  It could always be worse.
TL:DR   seriously just stop playing the game for a while and live life.

If your playtime is anywhere near the average player, then you would need to play around 3 months for it to decay a tier. 
If you play alot, it will take less days to decay. If you just let it sit and do nothing, it wouldn't decay at all.
Fyi, I play 7-10 games a week.

2,Question about the ban system,Umbral Regent,NA, 54 ,2019-01-13T23:51:43.760+0000,2,"If by ""dont do anything for a month"" you mean not break the rules for a month, then, yes and no, kind of. Playing games without breaking the rules will ultimately de-escalate your punishment tier/progress over a long enough duration, but a month isn't really long enough to go down from the 14-day ban tier down to 25-game chat restriction.
I've heard rough estimates claim somewhere from 3-6 months to drop a tier, but, rough estimates are rough, so take them with a grain of salt.
That said, if you recently had a 14-day ban, you should be on your best behavior, because until your account de-escalates a tier (which you should still continue on your best behavior even after), your account is one step away from permanent suspension.

Though I noticed a trend where duo bot laners tend to start begging for the lane and often threaten to troll if you don't comply.This isn't the end of the world and I don't mind it that much, but I was wondering if other people who wanted to play adc or supp in blind pick usually just give the roles to the premades, even if you called first?
Maybe I missed  some unwritten consensus about the matter where duo laners always get priority over the lane?Or is it just considered good sportsmanship to give the lane away?
I obviously have my own opinion on this, but as a supp main I might be a bit biased and would like to hear your opinion.

When I queue solo and call supp first, and someone asks politely if they can duo bot with their friend, I pretty much always say yes. If they are rude about it at all, I go supp regardless of what they do. If they instalock but aren't jerks about it (like if they say ""oh sorry, we're a duo, I hope you don't mind""), I'm fine taking another role. For me, it's really all about the attitude of the duo.
When I queue with my duo bot and someone calls supp or adc before we do, I always ask if it's okay if we duo bot, and if the person who called supp or adc first says no, we just accommodate that with no hard feelings.

hey! that singed is called &quot;Gassthej3ws69420&quot; [if this is bad let me know ill change it], toss him a report for offensive name

Someone.... cares.... about a name?

1,Which is more effective?,Deep Terror Nami,NA, 190 ,2019-01-06T07:51:51.741+0000,2,"Depends on the behavior.
Is the behavior minor, and not likely by itself worth a punishment? The report button is better because it adds this to other reports for that behavior and will help build up a case for the system to punish them for. Player Support isn't going to intercede if the player's behavior hasn't been severe/frequent enough.
Is the behavior extreme and likely easily detected by the IFS? The report button is still better for the same reasons above.
Is the behavior both extreme and designed to avoid detection? Then a ticket will likely be better, though you should always use the report button first; it helps build a case against them, improves the system, and people often aren't as clever as they think.

Silver 3 toxicity is some of the highest I've ever seen it.  It ranges from people rage-quit afking, to full on standing in nexus and typing while they could be winning games, to total-troll 0/12 at 10 min with 20 cs trying to rage-bait people so they can report those who have the audacity to be mad at them.
I report every one I can, but get far fewer feedbacks than I report - suggesting that many of these players continue on their paths of awful behavior.  This game is no longer fun; it's frustrating and at times feels hopeless.  Three times in a row I have been in series only to lose out to people being afk or toxic.

Talk to the people who aren't breaking rules about the game to divert attention from trolling, and obviously mute anyone being needlessly distracting.

I totally get that it would be iffy to give a high mmr account away, but my acc is like high silver mmr at best, probably lower from decay. And I've played for years, so there's no ""Well maybe you're systematically botting accounts up and selling them"".

0,My leveling experience,ChrilleN,NA, 106 ,2019-01-04T08:43:09.484+0000,2,"So, recently I've had the joy of playing off of my main and on some new accounts, and I've noticed a few things. 
1) The people that are smurfing normally outweighs the people that are actually that level. (Surprising, I know.)2) The smurfs rarely ever try to help the new players, instead opting for insulting their lack of skill.3) The amount of people that will AFK and RQ after a few deaths is mind boggling, a fair amount fo games eventually become 4v5's.4) There is an insane amount of toxicity, to the point that if my mains games were like this I can guarantee that I would have quit years ago.
I've been playing since pre-season 3 and I have never really bought into the ""League's community is toxic"" ideology. Because in my experience that was false. Sure, there were dicks, but for the most part people were nice and civil. But over these past few weeks on my low leveled account I have been baffled by the sheer amount of negativity and toxicity in them. Almost every game you can guarantee that someone will be insulting their teammates (usually the jungler or bot lane), inting, spam pinging, or a combination of all of these. Due to this I think the new player experience is horrible and I hope something can be done about it, because if it continues this way my favourite game will die. I don't know if RIOT could change it by making reports more effective at lower ranks, or what but for the sake of the game I hope that this changes. If you have experienced this please do tell, I'd be surprised if it was just me.
I just wanted to get that off my chest, cause damn, it's disheartening.Anyhow, good luck in everyone's games and stay positive summoners! (Even though I don't think that's cannon anymore, BUT IT IS TO ME!!!)

The system finds smurf accounts in about 5-10 games from it being new and playing pvp games. As you were a smurf account, it placed you with smurfs, which is good! It means the system worked. 
Genuinly new players suck ASS at the game, which is also fine, it be impressed if they didnt. The systen can telk if they suck ass at the game in about the same amount of time. New players end up playing new players. If a friend wants to play league, let them play alone while they learn, because duo queing with a new player will make the system think they are a smurf. Its provable too! Younger sibling wants to play? Let them make a new account and they will have a vastly different experience then you did. Its actually quite cool.

I always ban Brand if urf event is first, because I just hate urf Brand, but if I see my teammate hovering him I wont ban him.
However, if I just went against a Brand that basically solo-won the game for the enemy team, I'm going to ban Brand because I don't want to risk dealing with that again right after just dealing with it. If that happens, I'll say something like, ""hey I just dealt with this my last game so I don't want to risk dealing with it again.""
And I'm sure others feel the same way, as depending how well the person did last game can cause too much risk for too little reward in Nexus Blitz, more-so if you get that same person again.

Sometimes I just want to get out of a game as soon as possible because teammates are arguing or just being frustrating or whatever.  So after the victory/defeat screen shows I click the X or play again button, and then immediately remember that that one guy said some racist thing and I forgot to report him for it.  Or I hear a random noise in my house as the game is ending, so I leave my computer to see my dog knocked something over, and when I return I click to play another only to remember that player flaming that other guy.  Now, I can hope that someone else reported these people, but it would still be nice to be able to go back and report them for my own piece of mind.  
Even if it was a short time, like you can only report someone for 30 minutes after leaving a game or something, that would be useful instead of having to send in a support ticket with a link to match history so they can look into my report and then tell me one more time that I should ""use the report system in the end game screen"".

I didnt start it mind you, this feeding duo (0-11 mid and 1-11 jg) were being racist towards me and saying  i must be trash because im black, but i totally took the bait and crossed acceptable lines.
I flame a lot but i never int, i never troll and i always try my hardest and often carry games even as a support main. Even if i get into it with someone like the jungler i'll still poke his camps for him while passing by and will never steal. My winrate with pyke is 70-80 percent even. I rage even on winning games.
Im not here to complain, i deserve what i got. Im here to ask how you guys deal with toxicity and feeders/inters without getting mad? what do you do to keep yourself off tilt?
How do i be a better person and player and calm tf down?

You said you grew up with some pretty bad influences right? Yeah it makes sense because it seems like by watching her behavior you have from the bottom of your heart subconsciously started copying her. I've personally played with a couple of players over 30 and they're all less susceptible to rage, like they still get angry and frustrated but then they just get over it. You should find some more mature players that are better at containing their rage, and make them your  role models. Surround yourself with people you look up to, because slowly you will undo a lot of the effects from the negative influences that had been around you.
Another thing is you gotta understand where you are coming from, and where the other person is coming from. By the former I meant, you're really just here to play a game correct? Pride doesn't last any longer than the end of game screen, so just hold it until then, as soon as the game is over all your anguish will disappear. By the latter, I meant if you get permabanned you must have said some pretty bad things right? There's a reason those things are zero tolerance. Have you really been fair to others, and to those words, by using them without knowing what their full implications are?
Finally and this is if you have emotionally issues, you have to learn to be the controller, not the controllee. There is nothing more vulnerable than a person who is easily influenced by their surroundings. If you get mad then you are allowing the world around you to pull your strings. Know that you can break free of them, but taking a step back, even if it is a small one, and just examine the situation at hand. I personally like to imagine a ring of bells around me, and that each one of them corresponds to a certain emotion. Everytime I feel that emotion rising I would toll that bell to acknowledge it. It works so well because as the ringing resounds I am allowed a moment of peace to rethink my actions. If I feel lazy, the lazy bell, if I feel angry the angry bell, if i feel greedy, the greedy bell. 
^_^ best of luck!

We started off the game and my initial plan was to place a ward in the river botside first to watch for invades and then go to my bird camp since I can solo. I was initially hoping Fizzer would get a leash for blue or something but he instead he followed me to the bird camp and tried to wait for me to lower everything for him to last hit. He kept following me around and kept last hitting camps with smite or Empowered Leap Strike resulting in me being Lv. 1 for like the first 4 minutes. No matter where I'd go, he'd follow and if I'd gank he'd be busy avoiding fights just farming and taking as many camps as possible.
Despite him having more gold than me in the end of the game he still had the same dreadful score of 2/9/2.
I have a feeling some of you will just tell me to play Draft but I'm not too sure my champion pool is ready for that. LoL's BE/champion gain system feels super slow compared to other MOBAs I've played so it'd probably still be a while until I can Draft Pick.

The amount of games that i've played that were winnable, but because 1-2 players just gave up and started flaming we lost, is way too many. If one enemy gets fed and our squishy rumble pushing with no vision gets killed over and over. GG. Player just doesn't want to play anymore. GG. I can deal with high damage and little defense, but there is no way at all to deal with these kinds of people. I left out reporting for a reason, I honestly have no idea if reporting for giving up even does anything. There have been people in games previously that have literally said, in chat, ""go next"" and softcore int. I report them at the end, and nothing. Nothing at all. It's awful, and it really just ruins the game in general.That's just my opinion though.

It has devalued LCS play a little since fights are decided in a single instant and a flash of damage rather than a prolonged fight with 2 high players duking it out with back to back plays and hard to master mechanics with their respective champs. I understand your argument of the issue and am no way saying it's lesser than my own. It's just my opinion.

And this was not a joke at the time. In season 3 people literally wanted to ff20 because the enemy had this slight advantage, and this was not a snowballing meta.
Riot has always tried to fight these mental weakness of players. Thus the 20 minutes rule. which got softend down to 15 minutes when unanimous.The problem is out of reach for Riot I fear It is a general thing. Rather give up and start over again than fight back up.Even if Surrender was not an option people would rather soft in and have the game end naturally at 30 than trying and having a chance to win in 40

The game is just much faster that it was before. Ye, they implemented the turret platings, which made the towers stay alive longer, but now it gives a shitton of gold, which simply accelerates the game (the game lenght might have increased, but i think the avg.gold/min increased as well). The old more strategic LoL, with longer fights, more positioning, more chance to a comeback, time to scaling etc... is gone. Now the fights are decided in seconds, and being ahead gives you a LOT. And playing from behind is more opressing than ever was. When the enemy will poke half of your health having 1 item, DH fck you up on low HP (lucky it was nerfed), and so on.
Well, at least this is why i think people behave this way.

A Darius with 2 kills in 5 minutes in challenger ELO would probably be able to tilt the advantage to a 75% WR (someone please correct my stats), but in iron, bronze, and silver, that advantage probably equates to 55% WR. But because these lower ELO player watch their streamer say it's over, they follow suit and say the game is over. 

If you look on these boards, you will see that people get punished for negative attitude. 
But such punishment doesn't happen over 1 game alone. Negative attitude is considered minor toxicity, so it will  at least take close to a dozen consecutive games before they get punished. Not to mention it will take more games if they play clean games. 
By the time they get punished, it will likely already be past the ""recent"" timer and you won't get a punishment notification.

I’ve had losing games that were won by my team having a good mentality or the opposite team having a bad one. I’ve personally had many top laners do EXACTLY as you describe; over push, say gg, then soft int in ranked. I’ve also seen people display this through inaction as well; I lose games and I’m like “where is my team?” To find them being too scared to fight and give away objectives like it’s nothing just to avoid any fighting. Mentality is mainly a low elo issue as I think it’s mainly a problem that stems from poor playing and in a blunt way of putting it, lack of skill and experience.

It is extremely frustrating but there's no way to fix it without that fix being abused by people. Let's say the system automatically prevents you from being put into a game with someone you reported, well now all I have to do is report people that I think are bad and now I don't have to play with them again... Oh and now the reports system has been inundated with baseless reports by people who decided their support is terrible because they went 1/6 (because who cares about the 24 assists they got).
Your best bet in the future is to not immediately start another game, just wait a couple minutes. It'll make it less likely for you to have any repeats in your game and will also give you a chance to stretch, grab a drink and unwind a little bit from the toxicity.

A lesser reason is that it is preseason coupled with a meta that is ever changing as well as additional lane theories. You have people trying to make what they use to do work now, people trying to make new things work, and people trying the new things with out understanding and/or caring about the theory crafting behind it.

Well our Neeko support thought that was bad on our part to lose the tower, so they began to flame us, calling us r%%%%%s and pussies. He started to ff, say things like ""ok I'm done"" go into all chat and say ""4v5"" and ""top open"" and spent the rest of game afk farming the jungle.  Needless to say we lost the game, but whatever. I'm not going to sit here and blame others for my losses, but what the hell is happening with the mid game trolls? It's like a switch flipped in this Neeko's head.

0,The weekend experience in draft games.,SanKakU,NA, 153 ,2018-12-30T19:04:35.626+0000,2,"This is an unlisted video so that means only those interested in discussing player behavior will see the link to it.Please keep this in mind and be careful about when and where you paste the link or don't copy it at all if you're unsure.
In this footage, we see the typical behavior that is more common on the weekends than it is during the weekday.
This is what we have come to expect of playing this game. It doesn't happen every game. I daresay most cases of intentional feeding are far worse than this. There are even some players that try to lose from the beginning until the end.
What I want to know is...if they care enough to give away skins through the LPP(League Partners Program) to players of their game, fans of content creators...shouldn't they look for more practical ways they can give to their devoted players who appreciate the game enough to give their contribution to the popularity of the content creators?
Personally, skins and emotes are fine and I don't mind getting stuff like that sometimes but I think a lot of players including myself would just be able to appreciate the game as it is more if scenes like the above(shown in the video) weren't as common as they are.
But what can be done about it? We can ask Riot all year of 2019 if they'll upgrade their punishment system, but as long as the affected players put more effort into finding evidence of foul play and submitting it than Riot does in confirming reports through the report system, nothing on that end will change. We can only hope for that. 
In the meantime, we can help content creators we care about to be better than they are now at setting a good example for other players. If you see something that could be better either on their YouTube or Twitch channel, you can mention it and they may see your point and make the adjustment. If you care enough about play behavior that you're here reading this, you no doubt are aware that nobody is perfect and we can all use a point in the right direction from time to time.
And players that want to be content creators that you wish to support, are you putting in any effort to support them? There were something like 200 streams the other day when I checked of streamers who had 0 viewers on twitch. Twitch can be an unforgiving place when it comes to competition. Have you ever tried scroll past all the 1 viewers streams to get to those? Or even scrolling to the 1 viewer streams? It takes a while to get there. I've been streaming LoL for months as well as other games sometimes and the only times I ever get viewers are when I'm streaming other games. I'm not the only one finding it hard to interact with the community. As a heterosexual male, when it comes to male streamers, there are a couple that I particularly like that I've learned used to play LoL but they don't typically stream it because that's not what gets them the viewers.
Maybe it's time for the community to move towards supporting who they like, and away from supporting whoever is popular. That way, there are less people that feel like just another number and more noteworthy people. Half the reason people do stuff like what you saw in the above video is because the person doing that doesn't realize that there's a real, live, likable person on the internet playing with them. I didn't get so frustrated that I started becoming part of the problem and that might be what changed the attitude from the bad state it was in.
Does anyone agree or am I trying to tackle too many issues at once or do you have some alternative viewpoint on this?

4,whats wrong with people,Hotarµ,NA, 81 ,2018-12-31T01:38:03.625+0000,1,"All good man.
 I know it's really frustrating to deal with people like that. I think we can all agree how frustrating it is to go from one game with a flamer to another with two flamers and then the cycle repeats itself over and over.
 It sucks. But just remember to try and keep your head up and stay positive for others, stooping to someone's level is never the answer and I'm glad you didn't do it in that lobby. Respect for that.

I recently had a 3 man premade ALL pick APCs and go mid because I told the guy who got autofilled support that I wouldn't give him my role. I'm tired of people thinking that it's okay to demand they get to play a role other than what they were assigned (especially in ranked) and I'm tired of there being ZERO repercussions for people who are toxic in champion select and make threats before the game even starts.
On that note, there should also be post-game chat reports because a lot of people turn on their asshole switch when the game ends.
I appreciate the automated system that helps keep the community in better shape...but there really needs to be more report options and more a hands-on, approach. Likewise, that system needs to be set upon a specific code of conduct, and there needs to be consequences for any employees who start dishing out bans that don't fit within that code of conduct.

I was toxic by report calling. I was also toxic by trying to get Pyke to say the f word again. That was mean to do, and if he got punished I revoke my report. Especially if I'm the only reason he is banned.I also intentionally grief because Twisted Fate did not leash, which I know was wrong. I trolled when Pyke said ""Report xin"" when I died to Ren early on. i thought I could kill him. Thats when I decided to go botlane and tax. I know what I did was wrong.  Also telling Pyke he would get banned was also toxic. Here are some examples: 
Chat logs break down: 

XVI Titan IVX: Fine I'll give you a reason to report me.XVI Titan IVX: Now you got a reason bbXVI Titan IVX: Next time Leashe me, and don't say report X unless they are actually trolling.XVI Titan IVX: Twisted Fate.XVI Titan IVX: 1/3 talk much?XVI Titan IVX: Inting?XVI Titan IVX: just say it 1-2 more times ;) XVI Titan IVX: Keep talking, enjoy your 14 day ban or perm depending on how many you have had.XVI Titan IVX: Hate speech is not tolerable.XVI Titan IVX: I took your waves when you said report xin. XVI Titan IVX: I did take your waves. XVI Titan IVX: I gave you something to report me for. XVI Titan IVX: Report Pyke for using the f word.

I understand that I got lucky, and should probably be 14 day banned because I intentionally grief. Since Intentional Grief is a 14 day ban on 1st offense, 2nd offense Permaban.
TLRD: I'm sorry for being toxic and throwing the game. I will try to get my honor level back up. Everyone who is toxic, or griefs please don't do it. It ruins the game for 9 other people. I know what I did was wrong.

I was playing an ARAM game today when it became apparent that the opposing team was just too well coordinated to be playing as randoms. They were kicking our butt, but this is ARAM and this is to be expected. 
A random teammate from my team started calling the other team cheaters for using VOIP to assist their gameplay, also saying that since they were premade this was considered cheating too as we were a team of randoms. 
Is this a rule? Legit question, this dude then proceeded to threaten reporting them as cheaters etc... and he seemed awfully serious about the topic. Or this dude just not have any friends =.=;;; 
It makes me wonder what the situation is; am I cheating as I play in the same room as my partner IRL, with our computers pretty much perpendicular to each other? We shout at each other IRL all the time when we are in ARAM...

Playing games without getting validly reported is the most important thing. Getting honored isnt even the highest contributing factor. Its just playing sportsmanlike, which means playing games without any sort of mild toxicity or anything. If you get reported but you did nothing wrong, you will increase in honor just from playing that game. If you get reported and there was some mild flame or whatever, but not enough to warrant a punishment, your honor progress gets halted for a bit.

It would require a VERY different play style, .. but it could work. 
It would be more of a Engage > Burst > Disengage > Reset, opposed to just pure All In. 
Idk, maybe you should actually try it again, but change your build to match. 
Maybe something more like Rapidfire or Statikk. You could still go for Blade of the Ruined King and rely more on the active to provide you more burst. Otherwise Lethality is probably the better way to go, Duskblade is more burst, but Youmuu's active gives her the movement speed to engage / disengage. 
If you're able to get far enough ahead that your burst chunks the enemy down enough that you can follow up with the kill, you can return back to the All In playstyle, but early on you will be missing out on a lot of pressure.

People under longer-duration Chat Restrictions simply resorted to trolling their teammates as a way to express their toxicity, so, Riot decided to cut out the middle-man and not give players who make repeated chat-related offenses the opportunity to turn to a much harder to track method of releasing their toxicity.
In other words, permanent chat bans just don't work. They don't really stop toxic players from being toxic - they only narrow down the ways they can be toxic.

The main reason I request something like this is if the player is successful in what they intend to do, (so make someone else dodge) then they don't have to dodge and wait in the que for dodging games. This kind of behavior leaves no way for us to actually report this kind of toxic behavior unless someone took a screenshot or got the username of the summoner beforehand. (and that is if someone else doesn't dodge before getting the summoner name down). It wouldn't be hard to implement as long as in the report system they made the tracking of the que accessible in the report screen (such as in the generic report screen on https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests
 ) or within the client itself (say make a screen that tracks the ques you had that were not completed). I appreciate any feedback on this idea and if you have any suggestions to improve the Client Report system i suggest i welcome them. i do have a survey below to figure out if others would like that as well. I would especially appreciate any Riot employees commenting on this explaining why or why not this would help or be logistical.
EDITsomeone brought up what happens after the report either reporting and then having to dodge or report then disband. The goal would be report and dispand if its something easy like ""im going to run it down mid and feed"" if that is possible. If it isn't then i would like to be able to report then dodge even if its the same penalty.  Also iw ould like to add a category to reporting which would be ""Hijacking Lobby"" people who hold the lobby ransom like ""if you dont ban/ban champion im feeding"" or something along those lines. 
EDIT 2this is another suggestion, if it is found that the person you reported was penalized for ""Hijacking Lobby"" in champ select the wait time to que up should be dropped back down to where you were before  (so if no infractions 0, if some sort of leaver buster is going on, then back to the previous step you were on)

4,Create a Report Screen for Champion Select.,aron304,NA, 169 ,2018-12-28T09:13:09.987+0000,1,"Ill role with your logic for a bit, but im going to go away from it after this statement. So even with your argument, you agree that people say things that are re portable, and cannot be reported under normal circumstances due to the way the client works in champ select. For the threats (and i would argue the other standard stuff that is re portable like racism, homophobia, etc)  there are no consequences and its very difficult to report that kind of toxic behavior, therefore because people know they can't (or at least go through a difficult process of getting the username and then filling out a ticket on the riot boards and making sure to mention it was in champion select) then it encourages them to do that kind of shit there. 
However i disagree with your statement of  ""im gonna feed""  and then play any combo they want and they try their best. In ranked its obvious that no one is going to take a braum adc and a soraka top with ghost teleport. Is there a definite way to define what is considered ""hijacking the champ select"" (im going to insist on this phrase becoming common lingo of the league community) Maybe i don't have it, but i seriously dont believe Riot games has some data on que dodges and behavior in champ select. They probably could make an easy enough algorithm that would be able to tell the difference between a person trying a new strategy, and a person who is trying to make someone else dodge. The best part is if someone gets falsely reported, they can just look at the champ select and say, nope nothing wrong and then not punish the player.

This is mainly meant for a riot employee, but I have questions on my chat restriction for 25 games. I had escalating chat restrictions on my alt account which eventually lead to a ban, and this really brought me down to Earth. I realized that I had been playing in a toxic manner and I hoped to improve my behavior. I felt as though I had done so, and then I got a 10 game chat restriction. I realized my toxic behavior was starting to return, so I took away the chat box for about 20 games after the restriction ended. Earlier today I played a ranked match and got a very intoxicated team who did not attempt to help and tried to make my team lose the game. I stood up for myself when called names, in a peaceful manner, and then the other team decided to listen to my 0/8/0 teammate Graves and report me after the game. I was given my chat log when I received the restriction, and I honestly did not see anything toxic if you put the messages into context. I thought about this for a while and I honestly found this restriction unjust. I just wanted to know if someone could review the chat log and confirm the chat restriction?
Thanks

I stood up for myself when called names, in a peaceful manner,
and then the other team decided to listen to my 0/8/0 teammate Graves and report me after the game

 A few things:

Nine reports weigh as much as one. Your team listening to Graves wasn't a factor in getting punished since one player would've sufficed. 

Once you get one punishment your account is placed on thinner ice, less and less violations are required to trigger another punishment. 

If you had stood up for yourself peacefully, you wouldn't have gotten punished. You probably responded with more toxicity which isn't the correct thing to do. Saying things like ""Can you guys please just focus on the game?"" or ""Guys, chill with the name calling."" wouldn't have gotten you restricted. If you really want a completely fair assessment of your retaliation, post the chat logs from your reform card.


 Beware, because your next punishment will be a 14 day ban, and after that the next will be a permanent ban. I would suggest taking a break from League or removing your chat box all together until you handle yourself better. If you don't have anything constructive to say, don't speak at all. Toxicity is not a valid response to toxicity, it just begins a vicious cycle.

 Judging by your comment on another post stating that you were banned for ""defending yourself against a jungler"" you probably got restricted for the same reason as the OP did, responding to toxicity with toxicity.

0,Honor LVL 0 to LVL 2. MOM GET THE CAMERA!!! (tips&tricks I used to get there),CallMeBASH,EUW, 59 ,2018-12-20T20:33:28.115+0000,4,"Hey guys, so I have quite some experience with getting bans and stuff due to being toxic or just negative overall. I have like 3 permas and had one account left at a 14 day, so I just created a new one and moved on, and here we are. So, if you are were I was 2 months ago (yeah just 2 months ikr) and just got a 10 game chat restriction that dragged back your honor all the way to lvl 0, and now you basically have given up on trying to get back to lvl 2, because of how impossibly long it seems to take to get it back, I have some quick tips you can use to get back to your honorable well behaved self:

This one here is pretty much the most important; YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSING YOUR GAMES!  Ik Ik i'm coming off as a bit aggressive but hear me out. I, like anyone, used to get really worked up in games when ex. enemy gets first blood, jungler ints in enemy jgl, adc goes in 2v1 without the supp. Ya know, the usual antics. When stuff like that used to happen my mood just immediately shifts, and I either lose hope at stuff at like min 2 sometimes. or I just flame the person feeding throughout the game, HARD. Because I get it, its annoying having a team that YOU feel is worse than you, or having an afk in different cases (more on that later). But, and I know this sounds cheesy, I once had someone tell me: Your games are a reflection of your skills, if you are constantly losing, it is not because you're playing with so called noobs. the issue is with you, ""YOU are the only one responsible and capable of winning/losing a game"". Once you have the mind set in place, you wont even want to flame, just try your best in your own lane and take your anger out at THESE TURRETS DAMN IT! ;). And believe me, in time you will get better that way. 

Anything happening in between 5-10 mins is pretty much irrelevant.  What I mean is, if your team is doing bad during that duration and the jungler YI is already 5/0 and has 2 Items, TGIL: The Game Isn't Lost. Believe me I have had games with like 0 15 during that time and still managed to work through it. Not saying it is easy, but the key here is to TILT & INT. Wait what the fu^k is this guy saying? The key here is actually to not do either of these two things, Ever. Just relax and keep focused, mute out your team if you have to, and concentrate on winning late game. Just avoid even bothering to flame or grief. Also, CC that yi to the death man!  

Play with a friend!  Ik not everyone plays league, but if you have someone you know can keep a cool head, play with them. Duo with them. Win with them. Flame with them.  Jajajaja isn't this post supposed to give me honor back? It is. What i mean by that is try your best efforts to use league voice, Discord, any calling service, if possible. this way, if you really want to flame, just vent about your team to your duo partner, not in chat. BONUS: if that player is not toxic, he will help you improve your attitude and in time it will rub off on ya! Worked for me like magic! Shoutout Goolarenz! More bonus ;) if the guy/girl is good, that is one less inter you'd have to worry about (but point is dw bout them, focus on yourself) 

UnBiNd EnTeR.  I'm guessing if you're reading this, you probably saw that suggestion and thought, nah bs wont work on me, well guess what, it will! If you are like me and do not want to feel lonely in chat, I suggest using this (need clarification if this could result in a report for 3rd Party pls). I used an unbind enter script (PLS don't ban me rito I'm not using it anymore :P) when I first got off my restriction. At first I unbinded directly at min 1 and gradually I started letting people in chat without unbinding until someone started flaming or I felt like I was gonna start doing so. Bit by bit I became more chill with what people type in chat, as I got used to seeing them flame and not reply, because my enter was unbinded. Furthermore, I became more accepting of muting people if they were so toxic it affected my mentality (0/3 yasuo please report this noob for inting jajaja I do not need to read that, MUTE!) At the end of the day, you gotta remember that its just one game out of many, and its not worth getting reported over something so silly. 
  PS. If you have a customizable keyboard, try binding the script to a certain key, that way you can just press it once and it unbinds enter directly. Warning: might have to restart the client to get back the ability to chat so, at your own peril. 

Never ever ever ever EVER ff at 15-20 unless you have 2 afks, Its always winnable, just avoid griefing in chat and play your own game in lane. Always. Even if you lose, you have not lost honor and could probably rack up a few honors for being positive. 

Just play as best you can honestly, people usually honor others either way whether they lose or not (I do that at least, y'all should too lmao) and perhapsyou could get lucky and get one or two! 

(Optional) Mute the enemy team if you have to. Only reason they would want to talk to you is either to harass, tell you to report their afk , or just be toxic. Of course I am just taking the worst case scenario here, they usually are friendly and do not talk that much, but just disable all chat in settings for a while and see how it goes I guess. 

 NEVER ASK ENEMY TEAM TO REPORT SOMEONE!!!!!!!!This one is vital to you not getting a penalty if some salty adc reported you for nothing. I once got a chat restriction (my most recent one I think, and hopefully the last. Was 2 months ago :D ) just because I told the enemy to report someone who was like, as toxic as  and  mixed together, but I took the fall. So do not bother. I asked a riot employee about this and they told me, 1 report, 9 reports, same difference. So please, no more x9 pyke for ks your'e getting the gold for god's sake! 

Honor others!Spread the love people! I believe honoring other players simply gives your account a more positive light in rito's eyes (I hope at least, I have been honoring some questionable players sometimes xD) So if you do not get honored, you honored someone, and if you all honored someone, you get a lil somethin too! Worked for me so far :P  

One last thing, just chillax dude.I got to the point where I have a decent amount of games with trolls ,afks, feeders, and the like, and to be honest, I try my best everytime to help them but if we do not win I tried my best at the end of the day so  ¯\(ツ)/¯. Usually people surprise you at how they come back in late game, so do not lose hope, and don't bother flaming because that sh*t ain't worth it. Otherwise the game ends and you realize you fed more than the person you flamed cries.


So! This is it for my tips based on my experience. For those who care, I just reached honor lvl 2, and felt inspired to share my journey throughout the dangerous lands of honor lvl 1 checkpoints :P. I hope this helps someone, because it was exactly what I could have used when I was in a bad place! Please do not hesitate to give me feedback on my methods above, and I hope you all get to lvl 2 this year!
Quick Edit: I know this kind of defeats the purpose, and please do not abuse this, but I think reporting people who DESERVE a report, not just randomly or for petty stuff, would help as well, as you are contributing more to the community and riot recognizes this as they send you the instant feedback report. So do not report everyone and try your best to avoid doing so, but if need be, report a flamer, but please be fair when you do! Do not get too worked up about their toxicity unless its actually really rude or constant all game.

I am just the average person who enjoys playing this game and dose try really hard to have a good game and work with the team. I was silver 2 ( yes laugh away). 
Last 10 - 20 games, I have match with people that are not at my level meaning dose not actively try to win the game. Has no thought process of how to manage the lane they are in, dose not wait for ganks when they are behind, dose not prioritize objectives. It is just absurd how bad these people are. Even CSING, 
I wish you could watch my last 20 or so games (Wouldn't take long most are done by the 23min mark) . And just watch. I do not do bad most of the time I go even or win lane (YES there are some games where I get camped whole game and tower dove repeated so I lose pretty hard)  but that dosnt even matter cause Mid, JUNGLE ,BOT have fed so hard you cant come back from it (Well you could, but the team dose not work)
I am talking feeds bot lane 18 kills by 20min, Feeds jungle 10 kills by 11 mins, Farms whole games and dose not assist the team, AFKS, Trolls,  mid and bot losing both up to inhibitor by 22mins

I can understand one or two games here and there but 20 games in row?

I don't think I deserve a perma ban, but I'll accept it I guess.  I just don't know if I ever got suspensions? Went from chat restrict (like at least a year ago) to permaban?
Can anyone (Riot) tell me if I was on the direct path to a permaban?  I don't recall ever getting anything other than chat restrict on this account long ago.

It is unlikely you were permabanned without a prior 14 day though. Did a reform card pop up to tell you that you have been punished and given a reason? If not and you get a small window instead; there is a chance your account has been locked for security reasons. Maybe because you haven't played in a while?
Additionally, time away doesn't drop your punishment level if you had one.

Yesterday, I had a jungler who did a terrible gank on my lane (mid), ended up dying, and I simply told him ""don't come mid again please and thank u,"" in order to prevent any more feeding on my lane (I was doing fine, but the gank ended up giving the enemy Zed a double kill). He responded ""you're a fucking idiot.""
After the first time he said it I typed ""b a n n e d"" (obviously he wouldn't get permabanned for something like that but just a chat restriction) in the chat and he responded ""that only works with certain words nice try though.""
I reported him after being somewhat toxic to the team for the rest of the game but I never got the Instant Feedback Report, giving me the assumption that he wasn't punished. I havent been punished in a long time for chat, but the last time I did I'm fairly confident that I didn't say much worse than ""you're a fucking idiot."" 
However, I am not the system. Idk what words are considered ""bad."" Maybe this was his first game where he said that, but who am I to know?
So Im really just asking the general questions, does the banning system only work on certain words and will I get an IFR every time someone gets punished for my report?

1,"I was told in game that a person who flamed me ""couldnt get banned without saying certain key words""",Umbral Regent,NA, 226 ,2018-12-18T16:17:56.832+0000,6,"To answer both of your questions from the last paragraph; No, and no, respectively.
The IFS, in cases of reports for Negative Attitude or Verbal Abuse, will look at the logs as a whole, and determine if parts of the logs are inflammatory or negative.
And, believe you me, he's gonna get a reality check when he gets punished. ""You're a fucking idiot"" is a line that will definitely flag a report as valid, and if he was being negative/abusive throughout the match, it'll catch up to him fast.
The IFS only looks for specific words in the case of reports for Hate Speech, wherein it'll look for commonly used slurs and/or encouragements of self-harm or death threats. That's primarily because hate speech is pretty clear-cut, and you don't really need context to understand that telling someone to kill themselves is just that.
As for the Instant Feedback Report, it's generally unreliable - even with semi-recent changes to increase the frequency of it appearing, I'd reckon it's still a rare sight. It could simply be, as you said, a rare instance for the player in question, since apparently the IFS is supposed to issue those feedback reports when a punishment is delivered, but I still wouldn't expect it to appear regardless.

yes the IFS is essentially a keyword scanner.  if the flamer avoids all the right keywords then he is never going to get punished by that system.  'idiot' is definitely a word the IFS would pick up on but it wouldnt count very high against him.
BUT people who get reported in a lot of games will face a manual review and an actual person will review the chatlogs and punish them if they deserve it.
there is a rumor that not everyone who reports the person in the game they are punished for will get a notification but i have Never seen that confirmed by any rioter.  i am pretty sure it is just a myth.  if they get punishied from your game you will be getting that notification.

our mid said she will troll for no reason but never connected to the gamei quickly realized my enemy in top is your average riven player so i told my team to not remake as we can easily win this.i was 4/0 before the 3 min mark which made the enemy support ragequit saying ""i dont need to waste time when the enemys are gonna stomp us 4v5 with this troll in top""
on a little sidenote... riven has ""zed"" in her name so i asked her if she mains riven zed yasuo and other ad champs with no mana bar.she said the 4th main of hers is full ad lee.once again confirming these champs/players would be less toxic if most people didnt play em like this:face + qwer key = 0/15 and flame.give them mana ffs then ppl wouldnt brainlessly spam and actually try to at least play around the skills.
which actually made my team believe in us being able to win it. after all it turned into a 4v4.
riven was so busy flaming in chat 24/7 it was actually more like a 5v3.i feel sorry for the enemy tahm (the 2/8/3 guy) who said he will quit the game as he cant stand it anymore and i quote ""the enemy mid is afk and yet we lose because of toxic inting people, im done with this game"".i told him a break is what he needs if the game is more anger than fun for him.
well as you can see i hard carried this with my 16 2 6 blindpick quinn and got some honors for it.

0,Toxic,Eisfell,NA, 99 ,2018-12-18T03:27:53.943+0000,2,"Been playing league for a while now. I'm not a good player by any means. I misplay, I get baited, I miss skill shots. I've never even tried to place in ranked SR. When I started playing this game I immediately was told to stop playing because I was bad. People told me to never play certain champs again, to uninstall the game, etc. You know the deal lol. 
I approached this game as a something fun to do with my friends, not something I would be good at.  I wanted to have fun. I still do. Sometimes I DO have fun. I love Nexus blitz, ARAM, URF. Those concepts are awesome because it helps everyone to not take themselves seriously. We just have fun together; a bunch of strangers all doing stupid crap and somehow making it work. Even if it doesn't work, even if we lose, it can still be fun. It's definitely more enjoyable to win, of course, but that's relative. 
The thing that is getting more and more unbearable is the trolls. Not the ones that make you laugh, and do crap like buy all rod of ages on Galio. That stuff is great lol. It's more the... intentional feeding, the insults, the toxicity, the ""imagine caring about this game mode"" when someone is inting or afk or tilted themselves. The ""it's not ranked so fuck you"". Refusing to surrender to trap people in a game after feeding and shit talking the whole game.
Yeah, sometimes I get tilted too. Sometimes I rage. Usually to myself, loudly. Ask my neighbors lol.  But it takes a lot to  get to that point. And Mute is a great tool if I feel like someone is going to piss me off. But so many people start a game looking to piss people off. Looking to make someone upset in the real world. Maybe that's what makes this game fun for them. But it's only driving me further from LoL, because I know it will never stop. People aren't afraid of being toxic because they know in any  mode that isn't ranked, there aren't as many consequences. And even if they get banned, they can just make another account. 
I don't really know what my point is, and I'm sure there will be a ton of people that think I'm shit or a baby for posting this. 
It's whatever. 
I just kinda wish we could all play and be chill. Laugh. I'm so over the toxic trolls.

As for trolls, I've found that the best way to deal with them is to try to cover every other part of the game as well as possible, and use them as a distraction.
Everyone takes a free kill when they can, so use that opportunity to gank a lane, or take a tower, or start a dragon. Try to make plays away from where your troll is, and away from where the fed people are.
Not foolproof by any means. 4v6 games suck, but trying to think of disadvantageous games as puzzles to solve is a great way of enjoying the bad games

So I picked a support and was just ready to play the game.He proceeds to die a lot, I don't know if it was trolling or what but he would go into the enemy jungle and just die over and over.If he had played well I wouldn't really care that much but for someone to steal jungle away from my nearly 70% win rate Warwick to play their 50% win rate Graves only to feed irks me. Later in the game, he kept saying he just wanted to double jungle... No communication in pregame about this, not to mention this strategy is garbage and he was supposed to be support.So, is stealing a role punishable?

there needs to be a way to report someone within the champion selection. i can not tell you how often someone starts talking shit or spamming the chat with the role they want. both of these inhibit other players from either knowing what roll they need to play or want to play

If we are to avoid toxic players then we need to not be punished for leaving the queue. i have been harassed by the same members from champion selection all the way through the entire game... and yet if i leave champion queue im the one punished and there is no simple way to report the individual. 

if the company cared about the players the punishments would be more evenly pushed on players and there would be  ways out of the game without being punished

If a premade team doesn't like your pick, can they get out scott free? If you are innocent, but people claim you are trolling, can it be prevented or abused?
If you are able to answer those questions, then we got a good system we can use. Short of that,  the system won't be implemented as it is too easily abused.

Also,for pt3: the system doesjudge and punish everyone evenly. It just doesn't do a good job telling you when it punishes others.

2,More options,Demon DARK Wolf,NA,,2018-12-17T00:48:04.972+0000,2,"I disagree with most of what you're suggesting. Reporting in champ select?  Why?  Short of hate speech, even if they pick Teemo jungle and say they're going to feed the enemy team, until the game is played, there's no way to know if that's what they're actually going to do.  
As for leaving in Champion Select, you do lose LP but not as much as you would if you just sit there in a queue with someone that you believe is going to feed or grief and then you lose the game.  However, staying always offers the opportunity of winning anyways.  
I had a ""one trick"" Zoe in my game that went 1 6 yesterday.  The player said that it was a stain on their pride and ego if they were carried so they started running into the enemy team, going afk, refusing to fight in team-fights.  We still went on to carry and win the game 4 v 5 because I told my team to ignore her and to keep pushing objectives and traveling as a group so that we weren't getting picked off and furthering our deficit in team fights.  Not exactly related to your post, but close enough.
And no, there wouldn't be ways out of the game without being punished.  Even as a support main with near instant queue times, I've been in match finding for 10 minutes because people will dodge if they don't like the way a team looks.  If there were no repercussions for dodging queue in ranked, finding a game would be a pain in the ass.  People would dodge over the slightest thing.  
My opinions here of course.

I think your idea could work for obvious chat infractions. Those can be picked up by the automated system within a couple minutes.
Another thing I'm not sure how Riot feels about, is privacy. We don't get notified every time our reports are influential in getting others punished. With the system you suggest, we would be notified every time because our LPQ and LP would be ""corrected"". 
One last issue is that people tend to want to report things that aren't actually offenses. For example, banning team mates intended picks. As long as the ban was not made in malice, we are allowed to ban any champion we want. It is very hard to prove malice unless the player admits to it. 
""Troll picks"" is another example. We are technically allowed to play any champion in any lane. However, I guarantee the system will be flooded with reports from people that don't like their team mates champion pick.

That is cause for a mute button in champion select. Not a report feature. The end game report works just fine for those cases, and there is no benefit at all to adding a feature which would take time to produce that wouldn't cause any benefit. The mute feature would be more likely to occur since it provides actual benefit.

You are not designed to use dodging to ""avoid toxic players"". The only sort of toxicity whichi s possible in champion select is chat toxicity which can be muted when you get in game just fine. Dodging is intended as a last minute ""oh shit i can't actually play this game I don't have time"" or emergency measure, not a ""tool"" to get new teammates.

Why should there be ways out of the game without getting punished? You agree to play a game - you're giving your word to 9 other players (4 teammates and 5 enemies) that you will try your hardest to win in a competitive match. You don't get to break that promise just because you're not having fun anymore - you don't get to say ""well if I can't have cake you can't either"", for example.

Thank you.This is the first time that I am posting here. I play in Silver 4, and I do believe that my rank corresponds to my game skills. However, as of late, I have noticed a trend that is baffling me, and makes me frustrated. I've seen players who are very good, and should be in a much higher rank (game play, understanding of game mechanics, very precise moves to attack or dodge, AA canceling of the opponent … ). They play really well until mid game. Then they suddenly go AFK farming of the jungle. Suddenly, the team has lost half of its kills, and now the game is 4v5. You can imagine what happens next. You lose the game.
I have read some of the other posts here, and some players don't want to believe what I have written in the above paragraph. But please, have an open mind. I have saved the recording of one such games, and I also have screen shots of a player (Which in this case was in the other team) explaining to me why he went to afk farm. In his words: ""I wanted you guys to win, I don't want this account to be promoted"".  I spoke with him a bit longer, and he told me that this account was his second account, and that his main account was in a higher ELO (again, his game skills showed).
You can also see the trend by looking at the history of the said players. 
I don't know what the remedy to this type of behavior or action is, but I can tell you that it is very frustrating to lose a game like this. Specially when I play as support a lot (Let's be frank, not many people want to play that role, and I rather to be the support instead of forcing someone else).

0,Road to Reform,Xavo13,NA, 66 ,2018-12-14T22:39:09.146+0000,2,"Hey everyone, a wonderful Riot employee by the name of Void Wish suggested that I come to the boards with my ideas so here I am. As a player I have been permanently banned four times on four separate accounts. Don't let that affect my credibility this isn't a bad mouth Riot or the system post. I have since unbound my enter key and moved chat completely off my screen (#reformed). 
     In all seriousness I have a proposal that I want to get the community/other rioters opinion on. I'm sure this has been suggested in some way, shape, or form before; however, I feel like this would be a great addition the system already in place.
     Obviously it sucks when you get banned for one game that made you tilt just a bit more than usual. Whether it was the 0/28 botlane, yes that happened to me and I did not handle it well (Chat restriction), or the jungler who can't help but negatively affect each lane inadvertently through mishaps.
     My idea is this, Riot should add to the system a way of instantly verifying that players are taking steps to reform. Whether it be verifying through checking settings, such as the chat box being off the screen, or simply proving you have the program that allows you to unbind the enter key. 
     At the very least, I feel like players should be open about other accounts they have as well. What I mean by that is as follows: Say I was to be banned for two weeks, but I have another account to play on. A request could be sent in to Riot to monitor their reform progress, and have checkpoints throughout the process that mitigates the initial ban on the other account. 
     Obviously I'm not on the Riot team myself and don't know what the checkpoints would be or how one would qualify for the process or not. These are my ideas though, and I hope that you guys like them. Any creative suggestions to further along this idea would be appreciated. 
Cheers,Xavo13

Reforming is one of the hardest things to do in this game imo.Climbing is easy, but learning to not be toxic is so hard for me.
"
4,Road to Reform,Xavo13,NA, 66 ,2018-12-14T23:12:25.934+0000,1,"Fair enough. The human mind is one of the most powerful things in this world, if not the most. I think showing your perseverance will go a long way. It's all up to the player, Riot is there to help you in the best way they can obviously. It just comes down to people's willingness to reform. As long as you are genuinely taking steps to do so, it becomes easier in my opinion. A trick I use is having something near me to distract me when I die in a tilting way or someone does something rather foolish. Whether it's a stress ball or jumping into bed, looking away from the screen so you get a brief reprieve from the game can be a big help!

5,Road to Reform,ChaosReyn,NA, 66 ,2018-12-15T16:49:40.394+0000,1,"My main was perma'd last season, after being live from the 1st season in. I took it hard. But I can't say I didn't earn the perma any more than I can say I regret what caused it.
People tilt. It happens. People tilt a lot faster when there's 2-4 other people trying to tell them that they're the reason that the game is lost before 10 minutes has even passed, and you have better game stats than the majority of them.
What needs to happen is that riot needs to take permabans more seriously when they're dishing them out. Currently, I'm decently sure that, even though the 14-day and permabans are definitely manual, the people who issue them go based off of how many times their bots have pinged you and made action (which can be negatively influenced by other factors, such as multi-queued groups just stacking reports on you because you're the guy who isn't in their squad), and by certain keywords, particularly swearing.
As I said: tilt happens, and it happens a lot faster when provoked. These guys aren't looking through the entire gameplay text when they issue your ban, they're stopping at the first time you drop that f-bomb, and the context rarely matters. ""f- off, muted"" is just as bad to them as an all out nuclear meltdown in chat. That f-bomb is all they need to see to think ""yep, he's negative, banhammer him.""
There's not really a sense of empathy and context to it, just ""ope, f-bomb, hit em and go."" even if that f-bomb was ""f - -k, I didn't see their whole team was there."" in a game where your team decides they want to report you for inting when in reality you just got caught out too much.
I'll be the first to admit that I earned my own perma: my best defense to a team full of people blaming me for losing a game pre-10m at that point was ripping them a new one and hoping they go down with me if I got a punishment. But that is certainly not always the case.

i was in a game where someone didn't get the champ they wanted (aram) and because of that he sat back, behind turret, using summoner spells and abilities off cd, and refused to do anything useful, didn't hit a champ all game, and used relics as they came up just to be detrimental to the team.is there somewhere where i can post photos, to Try to get this guy what he actually deserves? because sometimes ingame reports just won't do, when someone is clearly being toxic.
note that while we were in the first stage of the game, he stood on the relic area behind turret, just so it got used as quickly as possible. even so much as to E or flash (he was playing tryndamere) so that he could get to the relic before someone else who needed it.

0,What I see inting as:,Around999People,NA, 134 ,2018-12-12T16:25:40.649+0000,6,"I'm an S4 hard stuck scrub so my opinion may not matter, but I'm honor 5 with honors  nearly every game and havent gotten so much as a warning since ai started playing way back in S2.
So, what do I see as inting, and thus a reportable offense. Inting, or intentionally feeding is any action done with the intent to lower your teams chances of winning or to increase your enemies chance of winning. 
A player who is behind and under fed will die. It's a fact in this meta. You fall behind even slightly and your kda will suck. That is not inting. Let me give two scenarios. 
1) Lucian is 0/5, staying under tower and doing his best to farm and not feed but the enemy jg is tower diving them. The lucian is not inting but trying to make the best of his position. 
2) lucian us 0/5 and goes top to farm. Pushes up to the enemy tower. He dies. He does it again. And again. And again. And he keeps dying and keeps going. This is inting because he isnt playing safe. He knows he will die and get nothing done and yet he keeps going. He is intentionally dying at this point. 
Now this is where I want to bring up something that a lot of people may not agree with, and typically the people who dont agree with this are the same people it's about. 
If you're doing something to tilt your team you are inting. You are making the active choice to make one of your team play worse rather than to help them. You are lowering your teams chances of winning. Spam pining them, insulting them, even spamming about how they are inting Is all you inting. 
How does one not int? Well, just don't flame. Don't be toxic. If someone is inting then they want you to react so you doing anything of the above gives them what you want and makes you no better than them. Just face the reality of your situation. You flame, you get banned. You don't flame, you don't get banned. You don't flame but focus on winning or even improving yourself you'll be better off for it. If you lose the match, well, you'd be just as responsible for it

Good splitpushers can make effective use of being not worth gold by constantly splitting and ""Dying"" but taking objectives. Essentially an ""inting sion"" strategy, but champions other than sion can make it work. 
I'm a Jax main, and there have been games where I left lane  as bad as 0-6, and just told my team ""hold until late."" My team would group as 4 and defend sieges, while I would go balls to the wall trying to get towers. In one game in particular,  I was at one point 1-18; however, I had effectively taken 6 towers, granting my team gold and farming all the while. We actually succeeded in making the comeback and I finished with a quadra kill to seal it. While my teammates weren't happy I kept dying during the game, even the enemy team's urgot said what I was doing was the best possible way to keep the game alive. While I wouldn't always recommend this strategy, just be aware that Inting = trying to lose, not just dying a lot.

Yeah, flaming's bad and it hurts your team's chances of winning. And intentional feeding is one of the worst things you can do in the game. But that doesn't mean you just go and throw all bad behavior under ""intentional feeding"" as a blanket term.

If you behave poorly, your honor progress suffers. If you behave well and get regularly honors & the honor bonus, your honor goes up faster.

It took me about 125 games per checkpoint (and about 180 for the honor unlock) without any validated reports since my chat restrict, as confirmed by Support on a weekly basis (I check in with them regularly). For some of my friends, it took about the same, while others it took much less. I'm on the final checkpoint now, almost at Honor 2 and it has been an arduous journey. All you can do is just play and spam games (as Riot Support instructs you to do) and make sure to minimize your usage of chat to compliments and team communication. Stick to shorter game modes, such as Co-op Vs AI (3v3 is best for this), ARAM, and Nexus Blitz. Don't expect it to be an easy climb back. You can open a ticket or live chat with Support if you're worried about your progress, and they can check if you've been validly reported (which slows honor) or not. Good luck.

0,Playing less and less,king of all bush,NA, 98 ,2018-12-12T07:50:33.602+0000,2,"See, I'm just a silver player and I don't play this game as much as I used to. I work a lot.I used to get hyped up for this game, just to play one game after classes it would make me so happy. Not only that but I spent so much money in this game that it's the reason why I keep playing right now.Take this as a customer review or whatever but this here is from the heart:
2018 December, Just logging in to play makes me sick now. I find myself playing a random game which I never thought i'd play just to avoid league. And when I do log on and try to start a game I find myself thinking that the game I'm about to play will only bring me more stress before I even finish typing my password in the game client.
The reason I feel that way is not the game play or the new patch that comes every now and then. Even though it feels like a completely different game (when you don't play for few months), the game it self is evolving well. I'm just tired of the community. Almost 98% of the silver players can't stop saying the words ""idiot"" ""dumb F*"" when they start a sentence. It's crazy at this point.I try muting all players or that one toxic player but sometimes it is necessary to let them know the game plan, so I type. I think its necessary sometimes to communicate using the chat in this elo.
This is just my thought on why I'm playing less and less every time. I love this game don't get me wrong but the community is really sick.And if I feel that way I'm sure there are at least a few people who feels the same way and don't really have time to talk about it. This is my first time using this platform and I hope it would be the last.GG

0,Banning Vs Not Banning,Demon DARK Wolf,NA, 144 ,2018-12-12T10:41:49.220+0000,1,"A suggestion more than anything.  
I've ran into a lot of people choosing not to ban lately and I've had those same players complain about champions being OP after another lane or even their own gets fed.  
If there's nobody that you feel like needs banned, just ask your team if they have a ban request.  It could be someone you didn't think about, or even better, a counter to a champ they're wanting to play that makes their laning phase easier.  If they don't answer, I typically ban a champion that makes things more difficult for my adc (I mainly play support).

When you do this to a teammate don't be surprised when they play poorly, and don't blame them either. You banned their champ, so they'll be playing something they weren't as prepared for, and they'll likely be upset.
Now you might make the argument ""well they should be able to play more than one champion,"" and you're right. However, you also need to acknowledge that your choice was less than sportsmanlike and may have consequences.
Optimally you could ask for their input first, and get them to decide on a different champion in their own.

0,Players do not care about the outcome of the game.,ııIlllIıIIllIııı,EUW, 27 ,2018-12-09T16:50:21.708+0000,7,"Hello,
first of all I want to introduce myself and tell you this is mostlikely a question with some background. I fall into category of toxic players currently sitting on 19 permabans or little less. I am writing this just so you can make an picture of me and maybe imagine my perspective on this topic.What I want to talk about is increasing number of players who just start the launcher, choose the gamemode (ranked) and start Q.
This game as we know has 5v5 and 3v3 ranked systems. Best example for this will be 5 v 5 Summoners Rift.
As I said players start Q and here we are in champion select. Most of the player base do not even care about team composition or their own picks. Alright I do understand that you want to play certain hero you have chose before you even got to lobby but at this moment they got hard counter for it  and you will most certainly not going to do well agaisnt it. Their answer for this is I do not care and immediately starting to call me toxic because I want them to choose something different.
So the games on and as expected our let's say top starts typing how should he perform well when jungler can not gank toplane after he already gave enemy two solo kills and twice was under their tower and got ganked. You just press TAB and realise this guy has no Ninja Tabies/Mercury's Treads which are great agaisnt their toplane and jungler at the same time and would probably help him a lot. This guy goes full damage making huge mistakes like overextending when he has no vision or he just can not see enemy jungler or just greeding for creeps. Great example for this would be playing agaisnt Pantheon or Quinn toplane. Again I can understand that you do not want to sit under your tower and wait for a gank but do you prefer to play agaisnt 4 0 0 level 9 Pantheon while you are level 7 having no farm at all? 
 FF let's go another game. My lane is the only one losing but when I am not a carry nobody in this team will! 
That's their answer. Well not really only the first part is even though their behavior says 2nd part by itself. They are currently the only lane in team that is losing. When you ask them to play their reponse is again "" I do not care"". You successfully capture botlane/dragon and ask them to rotate to botlane where they would have free farm and some xp because your team wants to take toplane before mid, get herald and then EVERYONE can group up mid to get T1 and maybe T2 tower? Again "" I do not care"". 
From my experience both teams usually get 2 of these mostly on toplane (that is why I have used it in text) and ADC. This ""I do not care"" attitude has huge impact on gameplay and obviously not possitive one. Players do not even to get hard countered or countered at all just outperformed. They usually do not understand macro as well so it is hard to play with them.
So how to deal with these players in any elo? I am asking for any elo because even though I can carry game up until P2/P1 with 70-80% winrates some players can not do the same and might have a same problem. After reaching P2/P1 I usually get egoistic diamonds from D5/D4 or those ""I do not care"" type of players and my patient with them just ends. Especially when they have 1K games on low diamond.

Playing ranked 3v3 is the biggest offender cause people feed intentionally and don't try and say ""It's fucking TT. Why shouldn't I feed?""

2,Players do not care about the outcome of the game.,ııIlllIıIIllIııı,EUW, 27 ,2018-12-09T21:06:04.460+0000,2,"People tend to not take normals seriously because it is not ranked so I can see why but not to the point where players are ruining fun/game for their teammates. I do not play 3 v 3 much except when one of my buddies needs one more person so we are 3 and they usually do great and I am terrible.
At the end of the day ranked is ranked. Sure it is fine to want to have a fun but considering your teammates would be also great. I must say I do not really care if somebody plays like a potato. Everyone started somewhere and most of us are not 1400LP challenger and even then you have those days. As long as person wants to improve and accepts constructive criticism from other players (no ""you are potato"" is not what I have meant). It is not fine when person says ""It is only game"", mutes everyone (?)  and continues to macro grief or feed. 
So you are telling me that I have to lose 10 LP wait almost twice as long as that game would last just because I have decided that playing with that player might cost me my account, - 13 LP and 20 minutes? Quick math inc.
Pros: Your MMR have not increased nor decreasedYou have lost 3-15 less LP than you would lose by  playing that game
Cons:You have to wait 30 minutes + Q time before you can enter another game while your game would probably be FF 15 or FF 20For some of us it might cost us our accounts
I think it is not only balance team that should do something. Properly punishing players who have decided that it is not worth it to play with some players would be also great.

Bad plays, bad decisions, are not grounds for a punishable offense. If they clicked into the middle of the lane and the alt-tabbed to read a guide, but got killed while doing that, that really isn't inting. If they are playing things like proxy singed and strategic sion, with the intention to draw as much attention to themselves as possible, but the team can't follow through with their plays, it's not really inting. 
My personal anecdotal experience is that I've only seen a handful true inters and trolls in my games, and it probably totals to less than 1% of the games I've played. They've been punished everytime I report those.

If it's the former, then, no, I've not seen any cases where someone was punished for party lobby chat.
If the latter, then, yes, it's possible to get banned for misbehavior in Champion Select.
If you're in a 3-/5-/6-man premade, you generally should be certain that your friends won't report you, but if you do get reported, your behavior would be reviewed, and rulebreaks in pre-game and post-game lobby will be held against you.
EDIT: Although the meaning is generally implied by the premade-size, it'd probably be good for me to clarify anyway, that the premade team sizes are listed for respective gamemodes;
3-man premade being the max for Twisted Treeline (Normal, Ranked, Co-op VS. AI), 5-man being the max for Summoner's Rift (Co-op VS. AI, Normal, Ranked, RGMQ), and 6-man being the max for Twisted Treeline (RGMQ - Hexakill).
If you're not in a full premade team, your behavior will always run the risk of a report by anyone outside your premade, so, bear that in mind.

The coder(s) involved have most likely gone through the easiest way to code the check (I would have too) and that means: Nobody should believe that full-premade-team protects you from chat usage punishments in team chat. Besides, if they are premade, they should be using some VOIP anyways.

I also agree that it would generally be good practice for premades to use voice comms - whether League's own party voice chat, or some other service like Discord.

If I may say, though, I have a hard time understanding how such an action could be necessary. Do you really lack the ability to hold yourself back, and need to have a punishment status applied to your account just to avoid negative communications?
I don't intend to insult, of course, I'm genuinely curious.
Another question I'm inclined to ask; have you tried any alternative solutions to venting negativity outside of chat - breathing exercizes, stress relief (pillow-punching, stress ball-squeezing, fidget spinning), etc.?

I just thought that chat restrict would help me not to argue in chat and ignore players' (and most importantly mine of course) ignorance since both is distracting me and my team from playing the game.

Just dont !You need to swallow your pride, listen to his calls , and do your best to help him !That means if he tells u to pressure baron or top lane while he splits bot lane , you DONT go mid and get yourself killed for the 10th time and then automatically tell the only player on your team that's keeping you in the game that HE IS THROWING cause hes not there to 5v5 with u.Your 2/9 my friend, that does not give you the right to make calls in that game, let alone consistently not follow or even do the complete opposite of the calls of the player who's trying to carry u.
And i know the reason you do this my friend, Its cause of your pride.Its the pride that makes you SO stubborn when it comes to making or braking the game.And deep inside you may even understand why someone elses call might be good, but never the less , you will still do the opposite just so you can say ""he cant tell me what to do"".
Well guess what bud , this game is not about pride, its about wining. The moment you queue Ranked, you went into the game to CLIMB, to WIN, not to prove some worthless point to someone your gonna forget about 2 games after.

Even if they're making the wrong calls, having everyone on the same page all the time, is going to exponentially increase your chances of winning in solo queue rather than creating division and everyone separating to do random stuff and getting nothing done.

I'd back you up in telling me I'm being an idiot. Why? Because I am. If I'm too dumb to listen to polite advice, pings and tone-neutral chat communication to stop me from doing idiotic suicidal things over and over, then sad but true is that offensive stuff sometimes actually makes the point sink in. People can be whiny selfish babies who are spoiled and think they can get away with anything... until someone slaps them across the face and tells them that what they are doing is wrong. It might not be nice. It's not what the person slapping them WANTED to do in the first place, but it's for their own good. Better to give them a little pain now and wake them up to their terrible behavior so they can reform than to let them go on being a whiny brainless jackass their whole life.
At least that's my take on the matter. Honestly it reminds me of a story this police officer told me. There was a first grader who started acting out in class one day and was throwing kids' class materials, knocking desks around, etc. And due to administration screwing over a previous teacher for stepping in in a scenario like that, all the teacher could do was get the rest of the class to the back of the classroom and do his best to shield the other students from things being thrown at them. Touch the kid to restrain him from trying to hurt others and that teacher could have been the second one in 2 years to be sued and fired...career down the drain. So the police were called because the principal couldn't restrain the kid either for the same reasons as the teacher. Well the officer came into the room after more than 15 min of the kid terrorizing the whole class and tried talking the kid down first. The kid kept refusing to listen, so eventually the officer had to put his hand on the kid's shoulder and march him out of the room and bring him home... with the kid's parent having to leave work early to go home and watch him. When the officer put his hand gently but firmly on the kid's shoulder to march him out of the room the kid feined being hurt and kept telling the officer that he wasn't allowed to lay a hand on him. That's exactly what so many childish players in this game are like. They know exactly what they can and can't get away with. And when somebody comes along and has enough of their behavior, grabs them by the shoulder, and tries to march them out of the room for the sake of all the other students? They scream bloody murder and play the victim. And sadly... too often the system rewards them at the expense of the rest of the class (teammates and opponents). I've said this for 2 years now that the system is going downhill for Riot. And people don't listen. Instead they call ME toxic for saying so.
Well either Riot is going to learn to listen, or they're going to find themselves one day with only those who don't really care and will tolerate anything and the worst kind of toxic trolls like that first grader playing their game. And good luck staying running then.

I had an Amumu on my team in my ranked game <removed by moderation> and when I went 3/14/8 he just decided to call me out. I respectfully said ""chill out"" and he proceeded to tell everyone to report me. 
After this, he stops trying to help the team and went off to try to solo kill the enemy team which resulted in our bot lane falling apart and our top also.
Then I proceed to tell him ""chill out dude its a game"" ""you win some and you lose some"" ""not trying to int""
I get responded with ""I try to win but people like you (garbage) trash my game.""
I then respond with ""chill out""
Amumu: ""yas you are super report""
I'm tired of people abusing the report button, what I've noticed is that most people just report players for inting without looking at the replays and looking at their gameplay.
(Not acting butthurt, just saying that some players that think they are ""challenger players"" or ""too good for this garbage team"" are the ones that put in the least effort)
Everyone has their bad games

Why are you playing a champion you can't even play and a role that you haven't mastered?  Furthermore doing that in rank?. Your behavior goes unpunished which is really sad.  Also, you quickly blame people for making you play worse when in fact that can't be plausible since you never  even play the champion at all with proficiency.  These players are why people are frustrated when they play rank and lead to toxicity.

Attempting to rationalize to themselves and others that it's not their fault that the game is going poorly, and enacting their own vigilante justice on what they think is the source of the loss.
Bitter about something in their real life and the game is a outlet for their anger.
Some people are just malicious and derive joy in it. Many don't quite make the full connection that there are real people on the other end of the screen, so find it easier to treat them poorly because of the lack of social consequences.

You can try baiting them into a ban but, I don't advice so. These are a lot of times players who have a strong resentment towards the system, either they are already on chat restriction or been banned recently, they know how to not get banned so baiting them is usually futile.

People who do their hardest to try to tilt their teammates.

Are you sure this is their intent...

They&#039;ll passive aggressively ping all game, flame you the entire game, 

Pings are mutable, chat is mutable...and maybe they're just helping to communicate

smite buffs away from you, smite cannons away from you, etc. for literally no reason.

So if they're smiting a buff they are probably the jungler and it's their buff?  It's kind of an etiquette thing to ask if you're going to take a buff from a jungler.A cannon minion can be smited in the interest of pushing the lane out quicker.

You can be playing perfectly, be the most positive player on earth, and still have people do this. Why do people do this? What&#039;s their end game?

Maybe they're just playing the game the want they want to play it.

0,kalista bind,Kromu,NA, 99 ,2018-12-03T02:57:31.344+0000,1,"so I recently played a game of aram as kalista where i asked the team who wanted to get bonded, the team said to bind with gnar and i even pinged him b4 i did. After hitting lv6 and when i tried to ult, that gnar would just troll and waste my ult by running away from the fight. so, later on, I bought the spear of vengeance and tried to do it with someone else and I was unable to. not sure if thats how the game is set like that or just bugged, but what do you do when you have a troll/afk and really cant use that kalista ult and passive.

1,kalista bind,Eryl Fauna,NA, 99 ,2018-12-05T09:16:24.923+0000,2,"Rule of thumb: you should bind with the summoner you trust the most, not the champion with the best synergy potential.
If you are soloqueued especially, I highly recommend saving the binding until you decide who is actually gonna help you use it.  There is no shame in skipping W,R until that point.  Q,E only build will last you long enough to decide who is worthy and it's not too shabby damage-wise.  Of course it's most ideal to pair as early as you can but it can't be helped in this situation.  Also what Kei143 said is correct, the grace period for re-binding is brief intentionally.

0,Reporting Options Post Game,dcsorel,NA, 145 ,2018-12-02T12:02:06.896+0000,1,"I was kinda encouraged when the reporting options changed awhile ago to include some other behaviors. However, we lost some important ones as well, or maybe there were never really there. I recently had a game where the ADC went Rammus (yes, on purpose. wasn't a misclick). He then tells me he needs my help clearing lane, so i say ok as I am the support. However, what he really meant was he needed me to 1v2 most of the game while he roamed jg stealing all of jgs items and never really helping. He would help in team fights every once in awhile, never really wrote much in chat. we all begged him, (me, nicely; the others not so nicely) to please group up with the team and help in team fights. It was to no avail as he continued to roam randomly around jg. He would purposely go into out numbered fights in jungle but would refuse to group, work with the team or defend base. When i asked him what his strategy was behind it, he stated that Riot liked his game play since they gave him an S and that he was Honor 4 because all of the reports on his behavior would be thrown out because he did nothing wrong. However, from a ""TEAM GAME"" stand point, he made many mistakes and let his team down tremendously, I mean this isnt that other single player game where you build ""Fort""s to shield yourself from enemies shooting you. This is League of Legends where you are supposed to work as a team in the role that was given to you or the role you chose. Therefore, I believe ones behavior in the game should be reportable and people should be banned and lose honor because of it. I mean seriously, we lose honor and get chat restricted for verbal self-defense, but Riot can't punish ones behavior in game. He legitimately believes that trolling his teammates was How he was supposed to play the game. It was in post game chat where he clearly states that Riot wants him to play that way. That is the culture Riot has created by not looking at specifics, like who started it and who is keeping it going. Not just blanket restricting or banning everyone involved. Some are truly victims and should not be treated like those who instigate on purpose. Please include negative behavior and lack of teamwork as a reportable offense.

About 5-10 minutes into a game my 4 year old woke up because of a nightmare. I was afk for probably 6-7 minutes until I calmed him down. Got back into the game, said what happened and was sorry for being away. I was expecting tons of flaming etc but didn't get any. While I was away the enemy team pretty much took control but my team kept trying. We were all to far behind and eventually lost. No one flamed.

Things like that multiple reports don't actually mean any more than one report, or that poor sportsmanship like saying ""ggez"" is reportable. 
It seems like a good avenue to get information out there to the player base. There is always a lot of confusion regarding player behavior, reporting, and punishment. Having some information in game would be nice, since I've learned better by being on here, but most players don't come here.
I mentioned the things that personally annoy me, and wish more people knew one is reportable and one is useless (and also reportable I think). What would you like to see added to the tips, and why?

1: it works, just because you didn't get a message doesn't mean there was no punishment, also, NA.OP.GG can only check games, chat bans are still bans.
2: its a bot, so it messes up sometimes. but having someone going through millions(thousands) of reports aday is A: fucking pointless and B: expensive and pointless.

0,Why do Reform Cards no have timestamps?,SpringySpringer,NA, 135 ,2018-11-29T04:46:37.463+0000,3,"I sincerely believe that timestamps provide critical context for reform cards and there really is no reason for these cards to not include them. Allow me to provide an example:
Game 1
Player: Janna why did you go inPlayer: garbage
Game 1
7:43 Player: Janna why did you go in13:56 Player: garbage
In the original reform card it appears that the player is calling the Janna garbage for going in. This is clearly toxic behavior. However, the second reform card provides a different story. These two comments are completely separate from one another. For all we know, the player could be calling himself garbage after he made a really stupid play ( I know I've done this before). Perhaps not a desirable characteristic to have but certainly not a toxic one.
Should this player be banned? I don't think so but others who read the first reform card would probably say so based off the association that is made between the two as a result of them be subsequent messages despite the lack of a link between them. Further information is necessary to make a judgement here and it is not fair to judge the player without knowing this further context.
TLDR: Add timestamps to reform cards, no reason for them not to be there.
Edit: This is not a complaint and the example provided is not my own. It is merely a suggestion for reform cards in general.

0,Why after 3 games in from a 6 month break I view this game as STILL unfun and raging,Bewgamer san,NA, 54 ,2018-11-28T20:17:28.858+0000,2,"I realized today WHY I dislike this game and why I will, be leaving again. See I play rainbow six siege while its a different game (fps) and has a different dynamic its very similar to league in feel. Strategy with your kit and 4 teammates you rely on as you all work toward a common goal, but you if you yourself are good enough at the game can carry your team. You can 1v5 that enemy team they don't respawn in 5 seconds to kill you again, and you don't have to refight them you get 1 life and its what you do with it in the round. In league I can't 1v5 anymore I have done it I was an akali main pre rework and only came back because I heard she got that rework. I had pentas under my belt and games won almost single handedly but I had almost no fun doing it. The game doesn't feel satisfying when I do that because I know that 4 people on my team will rage and fight no matter what I do even if we are winning. GOD FORBID if we are losing. 
In league you are helpless, you are stuck in a 1v9 situation where in you HAVE to have that team in 99% of games to help you push and win BUT THEY WON'T DO IT. I played 3 games and 2 out of three we lost not because the enemy was doing better infact in both games my team was winning from gold, minions, towers, and objectives. We lost because I said or someone else said group up and 2 teammates both times ignored that and ran off so we got engaged on in a 3v5 then the last two teammates came in and decided 2v5 was a good idea because ""their adc was low"" in game 1 or ""we can bait baron"" in game 2. Welp dipshits what a suprise we died because you were not there then you dive head first to your deaths and get aced, and the enemy had time to go from the second turret all the way to inhib before I spawned. Meaning because one, and I repeat ONE DEATH, we lost the entire game when we had 1 inhib down on the enemy side and the other inhibs had just respawned. The reason we lost was nothing I could have done here my teammates chose the tactical decision to split push when it was in no way applicable and we lost because of their error. How is it fair one stupid choice by 2 of my teammates means my team can't win 3 other players lost due to that. Now I ask you how is that fun fare or balanced. We were able to lose a whole game from 1 death on the other side of the map caused by my teammates refusing the rest of the teams decision. That's literally garbage tier and the fact people find this fun is ridiculous. I can't and will not support a company who when asked to remove damage, adds more. When asked to fix spawn times, they make them worse, and when asked to do anything that would contribute to the fun of the game like permanent urf mode, they won't because it means less attention when its readded, or if its a fun combo that is silly but not tactical its patched because ""My balance"". 
This is my final goodbye league, I used to enjoy you playing malphite adc in normals with my friend playing yasuo support as we laugh at the stupid combo we made. Thats dead because the other 3 -8 players if we win report us and yell at us all game. Fuck your balancing, fuck your community, and last of all fuck your reworks I enjoyed my character how they were, and its sad when they don't even feel the same anymore just add a new character at that point. Stop removing characters and adding something different and expecting people to be happy. 
I could deal with everything else but your players are the worst part, I joined my first game in 6 months and I said ""I'm, sorry first game in a few months so might be rusty"" and the first thing I got was ""just don't be a retard"". We won this game hardcore my laner ran it down lane basically running in over and over expecting to win. My teammate when I'm 6/0 says ""first game in a few months yeah fucking right"". Like I would lie about this and if he payed attention I was trying to learn the new Akali and was basically missing half the q's learning the range and wasting energy at bad times. I knew I had a long way to go but I got flamed for DOING TO WELL after warning people I MIGHT suck as its been awhile. Good bye league I won't miss you.

If the only negativity in their chat is one instance of ""remember to report X for AFK"" or similar, they're very unlikely to be punished.
If that is repeated or combined with other things, it can constitute harassment and be punished.

I was told i was heavily reported in a single game in my ticket and received a chat ban as punishment, (lost my cool with a griefer). But yes, asking for a report is not banable, nor is saying you are going to. Threatening or harrassing about it however is banable. The way the OP described it also sounds like the case. Playing badly =/= reportable, asking for false reports counts as flaming and harrassment.

You wont get banned for. At least not right away you first get 2 chat restrictions one of 10 and one of 25. Things like hate speech or racisme or homophobic slurs those things skip the chat restrictions and or get a 14 day ban or perma deping what the person said sins it falls under there 0 tolorance. So dont wurry you wont get banned for it that fast. However i would advice you to stop askin for a report   cause of 2 reasons.

1 report does the work of 9 so you dont need to ask for it 1 is enough to trigger a review.
Dont ask to report bot lane for feeding cause of reason 1 and you dont know or there feeding or actually have a bad game you dont know that so you cant Judge about it.

11,"Can i be banned for saying ""report""",disregardable,NA, 108 ,2018-11-27T19:49:48.583+0000,2,"Punishments work like an XP bar. The bot will scan your chat log, and if you broke the rules it'll add XP to the bar. Let's hypothetically say, it takes 100 report XP to get a punishment.
On that scale, saying report someone and nothing else might be worth 1 XP. Insulting your team and asking for ffs for 10-15 lines might be worth 10-20 XP. Using racial slurs would be worth something like 80-100 XP. So basically, if you're severely toxic, it won't take many games to get a ban, could be as few as one. 
Keeping in mind that reports lose relevancy over enough games, if you're only saying report when you come across someone reportable, you'll probably never be punished. 
If you're saying more than just report, and also insulting players and asking for ffs, then you may receive a punishment eventually. Just depends on how often you do it.

14,"Can i be banned for saying ""report""",Chocolate Frost,NA, 108 ,2018-11-28T15:49:58.822+0000,1,"Technically, yes. You do risk it, but it is a minor risk. The risk of being punished over saying ""report"" is less than the risk of being punished over calling someone ""noob"". Which is laughable considering not long ago, an official LoL message welcomed all players by calling them ""noob"".
The risk is slight because requesting to have players reported in all chat is a common practice in game. It is very frequent and it's perpetuated by the false idea that 9 reports is greater than 1 report. When, in fact, it requires only 1 report to have a player's performance and chat in a game analyzed by the automated system. And only the report that flagged the punishment will issue the player who submitted the report the notification that a player reported was punished.
To avoid the risk altogether; instead of requesting opponents report a player, you could, instead, politely inform your opponents what it is that the offending player is doing to disrupt the game as long as it isn't something chat-related. It incentivizes players more to submit authentic reports when their opponents explain the situation because rather than saying, report, report, the opposing team is given perspective on a situation similar or identical to their past experiences. And that will give them the idea to report the offender. Not that additional reports are necessary, but if you happen to be losing over a griefer or troll then some sympathy from the opposing team might help lessen the pain at least.
As for verbal abuse, it is only global if the offender uses all chat to do so. At which point, there's no need for you or anyone to inform the opponents in all chat. Let said idiot dig their own grave, hop inside of it, pour gasoline on themselves, and leave plenty of matches above for whoever wants to see them burn.

I hate negativity, I find it tilting and unnecessary and yet a constant part of the game. I probably mute 2 people per match on average and this makes the game much more enjoyable. But the end-game spamming ruins the purpose because it gives them a chance to throw all their insults they've been thinking up all game non-stop, ruining the end-game lobby experience where you can exchange ideas and questions with the opposing team.

I have a few questions about honor system that i dont know if u can answer.I will give you 2 examples before i ask you my questions
1st example: Myself - About 18 months (i dont exactly when it was but it was over a year ago ) i got a 14 day suspension. Yes i was not behaving nice. In was flamming and stuff. After that i changed a lot. Yes, i can still be salty sometimes but i never insult anyone. Not my fault if some people cant deal with what is nothing but the actual true. But i aint here to talk about my behaviour. Since i came back from that suspension i was Honor lvl 0. Only 2 weeks ago i got my lvl 1 back and started earning stuff. Over a year of good behavior, honors and zero god damn rewards.  
2nd example: My cousin's friend. One of account was xXZeus... I dont remember his full nick. I know it had ""Zeus"". He has been perma banned multiple times. He bought a lot of skins in all his accounts. The last 2 accounts that he got banned were after the honor system start. Both accounts he managed to get lvl 5 honor and tons of rewards. CAn you imagine? A guy w multiple perma banned accounts, always for flamming, getting 2x lvl 5 honors and their rewards. 
The question i wanna ask is as simple as ""How does the system actually work?""
I mean, how can a guy like him get the best honor lvl and rewards when riot should already know - buy his IP - that he is a 4ever flammer w banned accounts - While a guy who only has been suspended 14days and have behaving well for over a year gets literally nothing? That is everything but fair. I got no reward for improving as player and community member and that guy who flammes and gets banned takes rewards. 
Does riot even trace their players? Why does someone who made a ""single mistake"" has to pay such a high price when others do  s* and get a Like + rewards????
Nice week to you all

0,Appeal for my ban,ThePhoneGuy,NA, 68 ,2018-11-26T18:10:36.222+0000,1,"Hello, I am creating this appeal because my account was banned only due to my lack of  self control and immaturity. I have no excuse for what I did.  The people I offended and insulted I wish I could apologize to.  What they did was the right thing and I realize that now.
But I know now that being toxic and spreading hate will only lead to more negativity and will not help me feel better in the end or help me become a better person for my team.  
 I’ve been playing league since 2013 and one off they ruined everything for me. I shouldn’t take pent-up anger and put it on people that don’t even know it’s going on, that was selfish and self-centered of me to do and I would like to humbly apologize to not only the league community But to anyone I have ever hurt or offended and league.
I don’t blame anybody but myself and I apologize I am not making this appeal to beg for my account to be on ban, I am making this appeal to deliver the message to anyone that thinks about being toxic next time you login to league, don’t be toxic it only spreads more pain, not just for others... but for yourself.. please think before you say something offensive to someone.
I recently sat down and had a hard look at myself and how broken and disfigured I was as a person.  That person is not who I was raised or meant to be.  My personal problems have nothing to do with the actions of other people... and taking them out on others lead to me losing one of the only things I hold value in. 
I regret all decisions I made leading up to the banning of my account the person who said those things is not the person I want to be.  
I would be extremely greatfulif my account would be considered.
Thank you

This should help you, OP. You can post what got you banned in the first place and see what the community thinks if you so wish to get a better perspective on your chances, but it's best to send in a ticket and talk with support directly.

There were a few cases of experimenting reform accounts, I think that ended in a complete failure, so Riot probably can't be bothered anymore. Unless they are losing player base at an alarming rate, but even so unbanning accounts probably is not the solution.
In the words of a fellow board member, you can always file a ticket with support.
Or start a new account and well, put your money where your mouth is I guess.

Please respond with reasons for this, I find it terribly sad that after trying to play so well and enjoy the game as well as provide you with a customer satisfaction.I was banned “ONCE” for some odd reason due to me being on Holiday from the UK to the Czech republic and having my brother gain access to my PC (Which has now been rectified and security has been changed) Upon arriving I realise that I received a ban for some games when I started playing again, despite this I have been playing like a teddy bear to people and put all my effort into trying to attain the higher rank of GOLD For the rewards I’ve been wanting for a long time, as an adult this actually almost makes me want to cry after trying my best and hardest to ascertain a friendly manner to other players. Please, really check some of my games, even if people are toxic I only send love and positivity through the match, despite losing or anyone feeding etc.Please can I have this counter reviewed, I can answer any questions that are needed to be answered.

See, the things you write in heat of the moment tend to escape your head after just a few minutes when you focus on the gameplay, so ability to review how toxic actually I got with colder head would help tremendously, I guess.
Would that be hard to add? I think not, since you already get chat logs on your chat-restriction card.
I know that some of you might find it silly, but for some of us staying non-toxic is actually a conscious effort xd especially since community is pretty toxic in general, and that tends to kind of draw toxicity out of you. So any tool to help is an improvement, isn't it?

I was honor level 5 same as the previous season and I was toxic for a couple games and they send me all the way back to honor 1 with 0 warning.

But are they soft inting? Or are the too busy reading their twitch chat and interacting with them?

If they are walking into the enemy mindless, because they are reading the chat, being on toilet, feeding the cat whatever reason, and this happens multiple times, they deserve the ban. What if I run down mid, but I do not REALLY run down, I just click nexus, then start reading chat. Does that make it less bad?

Are the soft inting? Or are they just bad, cos they don't know how to play any other champion (1 tricks) or role (autofilled)?

Not knowing how to play a champion is one thing. Making constantly bad decision has nothing to do with a champion. If your opposing laner is ahead, and you force duels at all cost, you are an idiot and deserve the punishment. (I'm talking about higher elo games, where ppl understand the game.)

Are they soft inting? or they up against someone so much better than them (Faker) that they can't do anything back?

It doesn't matter who are you playing against. You can play defensively. (You will still die, they will still stomp you on lane, they will still dive you and kill you, and that is okay, sometimes the enemy is better. But if you keep pushing in a better enemy, keep duelling him, THEN you are an idiot.)

If you wanted you could play say 11 matches one day and have filed 99 reports that same day.

For example, every 3 months if the player maintains high honor, no bans, no restrictions, they can be rewarded a skin on their wishlist.
To ensure it doesnt cut into company profit, the skins which can be given out would be low rp, or unobtainable skins.
For example, I want grey warwick, and if I maintain a certain level of good brhavior the possibility of receiving it as a reward can be done after 3 months or 6.
It provides incentive for keeping it cool, or even increasing the BE gained frm capsules for maintaining good behavior.

I have unlocked even a mythic lancer hec through the honor system with capsules and such. Honestly, honor is so easy to get I have all 4 honor icons from pre release and Ive maintained 5 through each season its been reworked. If you help your team, don't flame even when they tower dive a riven with no minions and offer help for example I know most don't like to think their wrong but I will usually do something like ""I wouldn't do that again, Correct play would have been wait until I pinged my ult ready and wait for minion wave to crash before diving"" or something like that. You WILL get honors and in turn rank up fast which also will lead to you getting capsules and grey ww. There is still time to reach honor 5 before reset! 
""If you wish to foster healthier behavior I do think rewards for good behavior should be given out."" this however shouldn't be an incentive to not be a tool in game. Plus you have to remember it is a game and children do play it. I am nearing my 30's and I understand that kids as young as probably 7 play this.

0,Two-factor Authentication and Curbing severe toxicity,Akimasu,NA, 45 ,2018-11-25T05:01:13.736+0000,1,"My account was compromised about 2 - 7 months ago(guessing). After a short and pleasant talk with support, My account was re-instated. That being said, The 105 games that my account ran through in low-gold made a very toxic experience for all who were unfortunately a part of this. My account had roughly 5 years of good behavior, so it took a while before it ate a permanent ban and shut down the toxic people who had a hold of it.
   This, I think, is a very major issue and causes a lot of the toxicity we see. The person who bought my account paid $5. Compromised accounts are a severe problem as the players do not care about the repercussions and the original owner of the accounts can greatly vary but some may be upstanding members of the community prior to taking a break. I received no warning. Between July of 2017 and today, I have one e-mail about privacy policy.
Two-factor Authentication is a safety protocol that's standard in most games, all banks and all (good) e-mails. It's the easiest way to give a very large amount of security without much cost to either Riot or the player. At the very least, an e-mail telling me that a different IP had logged in than my normal one would have set off warning bells and allowed me to preempt this troll's rampant tear through 105 games.
An opt-in two-factor authentication would have kept up to 945 other people's games from being inflicted with this trolls actions. Negativity begets negativity. Who knows how many of those people had a toxic experience afterwards that spread like a wildfire for the couple of months my account was active.

Can someone tell me why there are trolls who keep playing this game, and ruins everybody elses pleasure. How they are not perma banned ?

There are a number of reasons, first and foremost being: Trolls are difficult to catch.
Add on to that the fact that a lot of players tend to cry ""wolf"" whenever they see a pug - or, more plainly said, report players for trolling when they really weren't - and the already-difficult-to-detect-trolls are made that much harder to actually catch and punish.
Additionally, trolls/intentional feeders get one chance to prove their reform - they get a 14-day ban as their first offense.
But, beyond that, you don't know whether or not someone has gotten banned - the Instant Feedback Report is scarcely reliable (for a reason), so all you can really do is guess at whether or not the player you reported got punished.

Why when someone who flame trollers, get perma banned...

For starters, let's get the obvious out of the way:
Other people breaking the rules does not give you a free pass to break the rules yourself. You are not allowed to flame, PERIOD. It doesn't matter if someone else flamed first, it doesn't matter if someone else trolled/intentionally fed, it doesn't matter if you're flaming someone who you think deserves it, you are NOT ALLOWED to flame.
Second, if they got permabanned, then that means they've a history of flaming, and have not reformed since their 14-day ban. The permanent suspension is their own fault for not taking Riot's warnings and punishments seriously.

...and i lost because of trollers who like to try something new on ranked. or they are playing champion for the first time. It is ok for me for someone to try something new, new champion, build,lane, etc, but i think that normal is thing for that, not competitive ranked.

There's really no feasible way to prevent people from playing new Champions/running new builds/strategies in Ranked. However, Riot is at least working to make sure that if they do play different Champions/roles/etc., that they take it seriously, through the upcoming LP splash in Ranked.

Also, some players like to say ""Nevermind, it is preseason, no one cares"".

Sadly, this isn't new. People will make up any excuse to misbehave. ""It's pre-season"", ""It's just flex"", ""It's normals"", etc.
Ignore their excuses, report them if they misbehave, and let them try those excuses on Riot.

Do NOT do this under any circumstance. Just tell them to play safer. Throwing in the accusation if intentionally feeding is just insulting and literally helps nothing.

What can i do in this situations to keep my cool and not burst and flame...

Second; mute everyone who might be irritating you. If your enemies are egging on or backing a flamer on your team, mute them. If someone on your team is flaming, calling out your position, etc. - mute them.
Third; breathe. Four seconds in, seven seconds out. Practice breathing exercises whenever you're getting agitated. It'd probably also help if you had other venting methods - stress ball, pillow, friend/sibling you can gripe to, fidget spinner, whatever.
Fourth; report the Azir for Intentional feeding, if you haven't. Calling out allied locations is against the rules, and merits a 14-day ban on the first offense.
And finally; take breaks after matches that stress you out. Don't keep playing if you just left a match like this; take a break, and come back later with a clear head.

A lot of people who are assumed to be trolls don't even speak. They just go something non-meta and suddenly get shit for locking in, say, Vayne top even if that's what they always go and they have a nice winrate on that champion in that lane.
Should they get kicked just because they're not playing the meta? No. There's a few non-meta picks that are actually quite useful. But they would end up being kicked simply because their team didn't want that Vayne top.

0,Tilting...even when it isn't necessary.,Arcanister Wolf,NA, 118 ,2018-11-23T20:33:00.344+0000,3,"So to start off, I've been playing League for about a year now. I did my first season recently and got placed Silver 3. I'm a  main through and through (enjoyed playing him since I started, really love his character and lore, etc.) and Top lane is my favorite position, but I like trying out different champions and lanes and learning how they work ( and  are some of my other favorites). I'm mostly a casual player since I much prefer playing Normal Draft games with friends as opposed to building my rank up, though I'm constantly striving to get better at the game and would love to continue Ranked in the future, especially next season.
Something has been bugging me a lot though as I play, and this is more from me as a player rather than players that I see in regular games. I've noticed that I've been prone to tilting during a large majority of my games, even in situations that really don't warrant being tilted. It mainly happens to me whenever something extremely small happens during the game, such as getting killed, getting zoned off of CS, being harassed or poked in lane, being camped, etc.. When it happens, I get extremely mad at myself, constantly blaming myself, calling myself stupid, telling myself I shouldn't have let that happened. As the game goes on though, I still retain this way of thinking, even when I attempt to calm down or the game starts going more in my team's favor. I've also been trying to find ways to get better at the game and see if there is anything I can change about my play style (I've definitely seen some improvement since I first started playing though I'm still learning), but I still get extremely mad at these small things and it's been a wreck on my mind, even in winning games.
TL;DR I tilt over things that really don't matter that much, and that impacts all of my games. Because of that, it's been a challenge for me to get better at the game and I'm afraid this kind of behavior is gonna affect my ability to play the game with my friends, as I really don't want to be a problematic player. Is there anything I can do to try to de-stress or calm down during a game and not get as tilted, even when it isn't necessary to?

Pbe has, unfortunately, always been for screwing around and abusing bugs. Remember the Lux ult bug and how many people abused that? Or the Nami ult bug people abused? It's pbe, no one cares if they're abusing a bug.
Live however, abusing a bug can actually get you punished. For example the Xerath bug that somehow got to live, people abused it and got punished for it. So, you really shouldn't be abusing bugs on Live.

You're not being held hostage.

By not doing that you've made a commitment to play out a game.  In some of those games you will be in a losing position.

0,What is Riot doing about Flex Queue?,DeportTheSupport,NA, 61 ,2018-11-23T20:10:14.414+0000,1,"What is the protocol behind flex? If you go into the game solo and get matched with a 3 or 4 man queue and they all flame you the entire game why am I getting a chat restriction? I am so confused at how this works, I have resorted to muting my entire team because if you respond at all you get the restriction because you have been reported by 3 or 4 people even if you just asked them to stop. This is the second time i have posted about this, last time i provided screen shots and submitted a trouble ticket.
E; The flame started in champ select when I picked an ADC none of them liked. 
E2; Does the bot look at what the three or four people reporting someone said? So regardless of what they do as long as they have more reports it works in their favor?

1,What is Riot doing about Flex Queue?,Umbral Regent,NA, 61 ,2018-11-23T20:27:34.971+0000,4,"
...why am I getting a chat restriction?

Did you respond back, retaliate, etc? Present your chat logs, and we could probably point out to you what resulted in your chat restriction.
Remember; other people's behavior does not influence whether or not you get punished. If a 3-man premade is flaming you, mute them, do not respond to their flame.

Does the bot look at what the three or four people reporting someone said? So regardless of what they do as long as they have more reports it works in their favor?

The answer to both of these questions is no.
To the first - no, the bot only looks at the chat logs of the player who was reported, as other people's misbehavior does not excuse one's own. They didn't make you type anything, you did, hence why your chat logs are reviewed in isolation.
To the second, also no. The IFS does not care how many reports are filed against you - if you get more than zero reports, you get reviewed. More reports do not increase the likelihood that you'll be punished.
Riot Tantram, the guy who wrote the code for the IFS, provided this snippet of the IFS' code to prove as much;

if (reports > 0) {review();}

Which, while I may not be into coding myself, I can easily understand that. It basically reads:
""IF a player receives any amount of reports greater than a value of 0, THEN their behavior is reviewed.""
It doesn't matter if you were reported by one person, four people, or literally everyone in a given match - you're reviewed once, and only punished if the IFS finds punishable behavior.

Just one season right?
You can still become eligible for the coming season, so it's just last seasons rewards you missed out on.

Unfortunately, you just couldn't prove that you deserving of the rewards. A lot of people have bad days, and a lot of people get trolled in lobby, but that doesn't grant you a free pass to feed.

and already got punished for it, 

Sorry to say, but the honor reduction and loss of rewards WAS part of the punishment.

Sorry to say, but the honor reduction and loss of rewards WAS part of the punishment.

i agree with you, but that was for last season, i got that punishment at the end of last season season, i didn't have time to play this season and with all the time i did have i couldn't reach level 2 honors it just takes too many games, i couldn't even if i wanted to, like even if every game i played i got honored by everyone(which lets be real, it's almost impossible, at least for me it's almost impossible) i don't think i could have got to honors lv 2 because i didn't play that much to begin with.(the main point is that i didn't play that much because i didn't have time or will to play because i was to busy) 

You can still become eligible for the coming season, so it's just last seasons rewards you missed out on.

what are the conditions? i'm confused, usul1202 said to ""check with riot support vie a ticket"" but he got 1 dislike, disregardable said ""next split"" which i assumed means next season? i don't really get it but i just assumed i was screwed so it made me depressed, and your comment made me confused with slight hope, you said it's possible than you said : 

Unfortunately, you just couldn't prove that you deserving of the rewards.

 The reason you ask is because what wish is to get someone punished, and no one wants their accounts punished. So it is considered harassment and can get your account punished if you did it consistently over many games. 
Besides, more reports don't get people punished faster, so there really is no need to ask for reports.
"
5,Is it flaming?,Umbral Regent,NA, 158 ,2018-11-22T13:25:52.877+0000,1,"Yes. Again, the IFS is built in such a way that more reports do not increase the chances of someone getting punished. The rough version of it is:
IF the number of reports filed against a player is greater than a value of 0 (so anywhere from 1-9), THEN flag the game for review.
With that in mind, report rallying, no matter the case, is effectively pointless, and in some cases can simply devolve into a form of harassment.

All said, though, if you and your friend only asked for reports once in that match, I'd reckon you're safe from punishment - the match may have been considered valid for reports, but would not in and of itself result in a punishment.

6,Is it flaming?,C9 Aphrolift,NA, 158 ,2018-11-22T16:08:50.698+0000,1,"By Riot's definition it is.
I think the severity of the toxicity depends on when you asked for these reports.  To me it's very different if you've asked sometime towards the middle or beginning of the game and it's creating a negative environment compared to asking for reports after the game is already over.  Although, it might be seen as the same by the automatic report system.

""Just report, multiple reports from a game counts as one anyway.... Atleast that is what people on this board led me to believe.""
I don't agree with this or think it works like this at all.

While I disagree with Faneseeker's comment (specifically the latter-half), the first half is true.
Here's two comments from Riot Tantram confirming that multiple reports do not increase or decrease the likelihood of a punishment.
First:

Multiple reports do NOT increase the likelihood of flagging a game for review. One report is all it takes. There is no benefit to asking for others to report a player.

Second: 

Reports haven't lost weight since the instant feedback system was put in place.
It's actually really simple.
if (reports > 0) {review();}

The second one including the section of code from the IFS which basically says ""IF a player receives a number of reports greater than zero (so anywhere between 1-9), THEN their behavior for that match is reviewed.""

""...from Riot Tantram confirming that multiple reports do not increase or decrease the likelihood of a punishment.""

Doesn't equate to this(what Riot Tantram actually said):

""Multiple reports do NOT increase the likelihood of flagging a game for review. One report is all it takes....""

Explained:A review might be issued with every report.  But what happens inside these automated ""reviews""? It's likely an algorithm that discounts majority of the reports so 90% of their player base isn't instantly punished.  How do you think they do that?  Based upon the punishments I've looked into/been a part of I would venture to guess it's mainly about these things:
1) what you've typed?2) your history of being reported & punishments3) who and how many people reported you and for what?4) what they can parse from the chat about what you were/weren't doing wrong?

It's likely an algorithm that discounts majority of the reports so 90% of their player base isn't instantly punished.

I'm gonna need you to explain this, because I have no idea what you mean by it. I can see that you're trying to explain Tantram's quote;

Multiple reports do NOT increase the likelihood of flagging a game for review. One report is all it takes...

But the explanation was already delivered with the second Tantram quote:

if (reports > 0) {review();}

But it's literally just the way it is - the IFS doesn't care how many reports a person gets. It doesn't matter if one person reports them, if their whole team reports them, or if all nine other players report them - the IFS just sees it as a number greater than zero.
The only statement I've made about how the IFS handles the review is;

...multiple reports do not increase or decrease the likelihood of a punishment.

Which is true - 9 reports is just as likely to result in a punishment as 1 report.
But, for the sake of not sounding like a broken record, I'll just leave it at that.

With that, generally if I see people claiming they are the best, and their team sucks, they are the one in fact who ruins the game for others. 
General negativity, cursing, and abusing other players lowers the morale in players. If someone is being told constantly they 'suck' or are horrible at the game, they will generally lose focus on bettering themselves causing them to stop playing at their best. Try to be supportive, calm yourself down and have fun. If you see a team mate make a wrong move, as in they went in when they shouldn't have don't call them a 'noob' or a 'loser'. Instead try saying, ""man, you almost had them. But if you did this instead...."" You'd be making a difference.

I'll admit, we could have probably pegged a plate then backed... but I knew Sion support was walking back to lane and adc was respawning. I wanted us to buy and return around the time he did.
So I backed, she stayed. Nothing bad happened to her, but she decided she had enough of me. 1. I dared to ward tri bush early once. I need to understand that's pathetic. 2. I backed when she wanted to stay and not reset with wave pushed.
It was time to teach me a lesson. The Lux waited for a good engage, positioned to start it, had me go in and just walked away. Lolol, not a single qwe or r used. I died. Okay.
I come back to lane. Now it's time for Lux to rapidly start autoing the farm as support and tell me It's because I'm worthless. Next engage, she walks away from me and Jungler cause oh well. No qwe or r.
Now she roams, and refuses to team fight or help a team mate. Just to CS and not help anyone. It's time to flame me in chat and let everyone know she doesn't respect me. I tell her I know she's griefing me and trying to bait me into deaths. She literally admits it and reaffirms it's because she does not respect me and I deserve it.
Like 10 minutes goes by and she tears into me again because I wasn't responding anymore. She wants me to know my CS isn't up to par, and I do respond letting her know that while I can't predict how it'd be if we were working together like we're supposed to, I assume it'd be much higher.
She let's me know not to blame her for anything and that I'm bad. Asks what I want from her. I respond, ""I want you to play to win."" She has a good laugh and refuses.
Game ends. In the lobby she tells me I'm getting banned for reporting her. I can't tell her in game I'm going to report. I reply, ""I never told you I was going to report you."" I report her. She rants about how she's invincible because of technicalities and Rioters can't do a thing to her.

I've seen so many players approach it like a Ranked game, with so much attitude towards other players who might be feeding or playing the champion wrong or whatever. The main aspect of ARAM is getting a RANDOM CHAMPION, more than likely someone you rarely or never play. So why do players get all butthurt if I'm a support main but end up with Kalista, who has severely different mechanics than my supports? I play ARAM for fun, I know it's a really difficult concept in League. I play it in between Ranked games or if I don't have time to commit to a full game. ARAM is for shits and giggles, not realistic high-level play.

I understand blind picks are for fun and trying out new things while not having to face against boring bots but that doesn't mean players can be douchebags. For instance, I was forced to go support FIORA a champion who needs gold and kills to snowball was forced to go support even though i called top lane atleast 25-35 seconds before a volibear. Then he proceeds to feed a renekton a champion I now how to go against. (I didn't do the greatest either but i was support fiora). So he proceeds to feed and he just brushes it off like ""it happens"" and blames the champion itself instead of him. (People stealing my role has happened atleast 4 times this week) I just think if you want a better less toxic community you should do more about it. Thank you for reading my rant.

Because the amount of times where I have a couple of asses deliberately troll picking/building and the enemy team just refuses to end a game when they could quite easily seems to be becoming more and more problematic and there doesn't seem to be any recourse other than quitting the game and taking the ban for it. Talking about a recent ap udyr game with a support illaoi with several decisive stomps against our team. game dragged on another 20 minutes because enemy team didn't feel like ending and our own team seems to get more enjoyment out of frustrating the piss out of anyone who isn't in on the shennanigans. God forbid someone just wants to play the game rather than mess with their own team. Of course cursing and getting frustrated like is frequently bannable but go out of your way to deliberately handicap your team seems just fine as long as you have the squad qued with you to make a surrender impossible then when you see it in about 25% of the games you play makes you question the validity of the report system seeing how pervasive it is in the game.

As a support you just do what you can, if you have to mute them to deal with them do so and just play it out. If they're kinda hopeless you can refocus your attention on whoever is actually doing well that game. It's just a sad fact.

Supports job is to keep allies alive.
This means the ADC early on, and anyone who needs the most help later on. Usually its the ADC, but if the adc is wanting to be doing nothing but split and farm.... then dont mind them. They do not need your help.
Also, if they buy 2 control wards and complain, then chances are they are bronze, soon to be iron.

I had a couple of recent supp games as Leona and they were so good that my teammates were literally calling me a god lol. In one of them I was lucky enough to have a really good Cait ADC who I actually called a god because she knew when to farm, disengage and to follow me when I would “randomly” engage. She helped a lot with her q poke so the two of us could easily all in or when our jungler ganked too.

They got greedy, got ambushed, then got mad at me when I wouldnt run in and die so they could run away. 
And Riot is genuinely confused as to why No one likes playin support, even when autofilled.Its not the champsits not the items. 
Its the fact that the supports are treated like the god damn WHIPPING BOY of League. wanna vent? just flame your support. Lost a game to greed because you ignored towers in favor of chasing your kills and forgot about nexus? Just blame the support for being ""too trash"".such a mystery why no one likes playing Support role....Hmmmm

Hmm, Who wouldnt want to play a role where you are expected to bend over backwards for your team, get No credit to ANY contribution. (we all know how the team will look at your kills, your deaths.....and completely ignore -all- your assists). A role where you are flamed and insulted no matter what you do (kill the enemy your adc couldnt reach? Ur a horrible KSing TROLL. Dont kill the enemy your adc couldnt reach/secure? ur a ""fucking useless support"". Heal? dont heal? stay? back to respawn? no matter what you do, they twist it so its all your fault if the match is lost, even by thier own stupidity.But again, Riot doesnt have any clue why no one wants to play supp, even when autofilled...

8,what do supports do,Doge2020,NA, 71 ,2018-11-19T19:53:48.860+0000,1,"I think they know more about support than we think. I think with the addition of Pyke they are trying to add more ways that supports can directly carry more with kills and kda too. Hopefully the new champ can be viable supp too, the chameleon concept seems really good to confuse the enemy during a gank, but sadly that might increase this problem that ADCs think that supports should always die for or with the ADC no matter what.

Just telling that for an idea of my experience of the game. Anyway this post is about the new players. What's the deal with em? the account I'm playing on is lvl 28, and I don't expect people to be ""great"" ya know? But I would expect em to know what is going on in the game. You have people jumping in and having no idea what lanes are for and what champs play what lanes, and some don't even know like the basics. Its making the game annoying. I hate getting into a game where someone or a few people auto locked their champs in the selection. Some fight over lanes. All this does is make the game experience worse for everyone who is legit playing. I have been into games where people fight over jungle. So we had 2 jg champs with Smite. Tell me why this was a good idea? They couldn't agree about who was Jg and one of em locked the champ. You would think that by the time one would reach lvl 15 or 20 they would have the basic idea of how the game goes smooth. Roles and lanes for everyone. I don't need to tell you how to win do I? incase their is someone new in here reading this, control wards are 75 gp. % control wards can change the tide of battle for a team. USE WARDS! freken NOOBS.

he REALLY stresses out boosting and win trading. i never imagined that being such a big problem. but the fact that inting is something that needs a manual review (so almost never gets punished) actually explains why win trading is a thing.
also if everything he says about win trading/boosting is true, then damn riot is legit not doing enough/helpless lol. and i dont get why they try to hide that, its obviously REALLY CLEAR to higher elo ppl what the f is going on. 
""grudges in high elo"" is something tyler1 experienced. as he says, once you get on the bad side of s1 in high elo, they will just int when you get matched with them. they dont care, they just wanna make you lose cause you insulted a friend of them like 2 months ago. again because riot doesnt really deal with inters.

0,The current state of leveling up.,itslio2,NA, 34 ,2018-11-18T08:19:35.282+0000,1,"Since its pre season, and i didnt really feel like stressing over playing ranked games in preseason , i thought why dont i create a new account and level it up for fun? and up until level 13 right now, ive had the worst experience of league of legends ive ever had. 
1: After literally about 5 games, i was paired against others smurfs endlessly. Some of who are over master tier. Now i understand why thats happening, but its making the leveling experience horrible, punishing the people who do well in their games, rather than ""even the fields"" 
2: Queue times are insane. Im talking sitting there waiting for over 10 minutes , only for someone to dodge. I cant imagine there is this few people playing league at lower levels. Queue times are essentially similar to high master- early challenger games where i sometimes even forget im in queue. 
3: Autofill is a real issue here. Its not like ranked where you get your role 8/10 times and you autofill twice, this is more like you play 2-3 games of your main role, then you are almost garunteed to support the following game. in a day where i play 10 games on average,  i had to support 3-4 times AT LEAST. If i was a new player trying to enjoy the game and play the champion i found interesting, thats the best way to get me to give up on the game and do something i actually find enjoyable. 
5: Now lets say i get autofilled and i played my support game and got it over with, The next time i get ADC, the support does NOT support whatsoever. Im talking getting irelia support that Q's every minion to take it, and threatens me to either get a relic shield or he will continue to take every minion, or an ahri support that kills every wave with his Q and realistically as an adc, you simply cannot out damage the irelia with her q with an auto attack at any point in the game. despite that, i decided okay ill do what he wants just so we can play the game, i brought the relic shield, but he continued to take every single minion, and the minions i did manage to take by luck, he got the gold for it through the relic shield i bought. 
4: Up until level 12 you cannot pick your own runes, and from levels 1-7 you dont have ignite or flash or any of the better spells. Which never made any sense to me. Is there any reason why this is a thing? ive read somewhere that this was the case so people can focus on learning the game and worry about these things later.. but making your own runes and having the better summoners is part of learning the meta and understanding the game... and in games where you have ghost and heal while your lane opponent has flash ignite( which unfortunately happened WAY too often) it could make or break the game. 
Why are things like these not reportable? I understand if a support wants to shove the wave, get a relic shield stack or whatever, but when hes blatantly picking a mid laner and taking EVERY minion from minute 1 then why cant i report him? Yeah i dont OWN the minions per say, but putting the adc behind that badly is essentially helping out the enemy team , and ADCs are the weakest champions in the game without proper items which cost a ton of gold that is being denied from selfish people who refuse to support even 1 game. It creates a horrible gaming experience and makes me not want to play adc at any point until leveling is over.
Ive played this game for so long, almost 5-6 years now, and still nothing ever gets done about this. It may sound like im ranting but i just want to see what the community thinks, and maybe ill get answers to each point from a riot team member. Thanks for reading.

If you dont play at a master tier level from game 1, you will be harrassed, shot down, spam pinged and reported for ""inting/feeding"" 
I mean looking forward to SMITE coming out on my switch next year.. But this community is doing wonders to actively chase away new players. No New players means a shrinking player base. shrinking player base means LONGER wait times to find a match. 
But this community would rather distract by pointing to a random match 3 months ago, or the fact that yeah, I take smite despite NOT being jungle (I find my own uses for  outside of jungle. 
I would say, enjoying the dying game as the community pats themselves on the back. I personally dont mind rescuing players by directing them AWAY from League. This entire community is a lethal poison, hung up on thier own self-importance. Brought on by riots push to be the ""Solo carry""The best way to destroy a team game?

1: After literally about 5 games, i was paired against others smurfs endlessly. Some of who are over master tier. Now i understand why thats happening, but its making the leveling experience horrible, punishing the people who do well in their games, rather than ""even the fields""

Just because a new player did well doesn't mean they're going to be considered a smurf by Riot's system. It measures in degrees of success.
You don't get to the smurf queue just by doing well. You get there by doing better than any new player could reasonably do.

2: Queue times are insane. Im talking sitting there waiting for over 10 minutes , only for someone to dodge. I cant imagine there is this few people playing league at lower levels. Queue times are essentially similar to high master- early challenger games where i sometimes even forget im in queue.

Part of this is due to you being in the ""smurf queue"", so to speak. The other part is simply there not being many people with that few games.

3: Autofill is a real issue here. Its not like ranked where you get your role 8/10 times and you autofill twice, this is more like you play 2-3 games of your main role, then you are almost garunteed to support the following game. in a day where i play 10 games on average, i had to support 3-4 times AT LEAST. If i was a new player trying to enjoy the game and play the champion i found interesting, thats the best way to get me to give up on the game and do something i actually find enjoyable.

Autofill means nothing at low levels. For starters, they're doing blind and bots at that time, not draft, so they physically cannot be autofilled. Also, everyone is equally terrible at everything there. They're doing random shit all the time anyways because they're still learning, so what lane they do it in hardly matters at all. And that's not even considering the absolutely minuscule chances for a player to be autofilled.

4: Up until level 12 you cannot pick your own runes, and from levels 1-7 you dont have ignite or flash or any of the better spells. Which never made any sense to me. Is there any reason why this is a thing? ive read somewhere that this was the case so people can focus on learning the game and worry about these things later.. but making your own runes and having the better summoners is part of learning the meta and understanding the game... and in games where you have ghost and heal while your lane opponent has flash ignite( which unfortunately happened WAY too often) it could make or break the game.

It's how Riot decided to do it. You don't get as many options, but at the same time you don't get info overloaded. It's a tradeoff that I personally find worthwhile.
"
4,The current state of leveling up.,itslio2,NA, 34 ,2018-11-18T08:37:00.568+0000,1,"i see what you mean for most points, But at the same time you're assuming only new players are leveling up, or to be more precise , only new players matter. Just because new players need these things, doesnt mean smurfs need to suffer to level up. so with that in mind, why do i need to autofill this many games, and when i actually get my role , others refuse to do their part and support and i am not allowed to report them in any way shape or form? hindering the adc and setting him behind essentially makes it a 4 vs 5 game, and there is no rule that says the support cant take all the farm, but the outcome in 90% of the cases is a lost game because the adc is a bot at that point. if they didnt want to overload people with information, would having flash as default be much better over ghost? or the fact you have to share top lane with someone because you dont have smite and your team has no jungler but theirs does?

There is a something you can do that you probably have not thought of.
You can send in a ticket to Riot support saying ""In the game that i was playing X champion, game length of X time (this is to help them figure out which game to look at... or as suggested, just send a match history from League website and not an op.gg) there was a player by the name of X playing X champion that was doing X things in an attempt to be trolling and griefing people.

They will give the normal ""We can not gaurentee a punishment is applied, but we can send this for review"" or something along those lines.
This will increase the chance the person is punished.

Game 1: Mid lane Yasuo died to Syndra at 4min and rage quit. 
Game 2: Enemy Varus ran it down mid (running into our turrets with no minions). 
Game 3: An actual okay game - both teams were friendly.
Game 4: Remake - enemy player left in load screen.
Game 5: Our bot died several times early and began screaming at each other in chat. Our support then went AFK. (L)
Game 6: An actual okay game
Game 7: Remake - Enemy left in load screen
Game 8: Remake - Enemy left in load screen
Game 9: Our Support purposefully banned our ADC's screened champ. Flame in chat. Dodged.
Game 10: Literally exactly the same as game 9. 

I tried to play 10 games today, with only 2 being playable fair matches. What the hell is going on. I know that the league community is one of the most toxic player bases, but I swear this has gotten a lot worse. Maybe it is just preseason and a larger % of players don't care. I just don't get why they are playing when they clearly do not enjoy the game.
Anyway, I'm going to monitor the three players who went AFK in these games and hope they receive some kind of ban. As for players banning other people's screened champion, this seems like a ridiculous scenario that happens incredibly often and ruins a game before it begins. I assume these players are auto-filled support, don't want to play there so troll to try and make someone else dodge. What makes it worse is that it is easily resolvable. 
Please Riot make it so if a player pre-selects a champion, make it impossible to be banned by players on your own team

Just an example: If you make crude/sexual joke in-game, someone could find it funny and honor you while another teammate could find it offensive and report you.  The report, depends on the offensive nature of the joke, could kill your honor gain despite you getting honored.
Being honored does not necessary means you are not getting validly reported (another example).  If you ""defended"" someone by flaming a flamer, you could be honored and validly reported in the same game.  Also, being honored by pre-made has very little weight.
Maybe submit a support ticket and ask them why you are not progressing in honors?  Or ask them if you had been validly reported lately and how much.

i got flamed by a lee sin for picking a squishy champion against a draven (I was first pick in draft)
i got flamed by a diamond 5 lux for having cooldowns.  Lux was losing lane against a velkoz so she blamed me.
I mute these people but it doesnt help if they make my entire team toxic.I don't even have to play bad to get flamed. I carry games all the time and still get flamed in those games.it's really unfair and i feel like riot doesn't even do anything about these players.
It now has made me dread playing solo games because i literally get flamed every single game and it has destroyed my entire LoL experience.I've been playing this game since 2013 and i feel like it's gotten more and more toxic over the years.
Riot should do more about the toxicity in normal and draft games.
anyway.
do you guys have any tips to deal with this because it's pissing me off until the point where i actually don't wanna play anymore.i absolutely love the game and i dont wanna get banned for defending myself against these type of people. (which is why i got a chat restriction in the first place)

2,How do i deal with toxic players,RJay123,NA, 150 ,2018-11-16T17:18:08.923+0000,1,"One thing that has always comforted me is analyzing my own gameplay. If you are playing well but people are flaming you, then their advice is worthless (if someone wants to give advice they'll do so respectfully. Flaming is not giving advice). If you're performing well, then you can rest easy knowing that you weren't the problem. Or at least that your individual play wasn't. If you were playing poorly then yeah. It sort of sucks but when I'm upset, it's more anger towards myself for messing up the play or having the bad game. Remember that your teammates are just a bunch of random people who play this game and if they flame, chances are it's cause they like typing more than playing. Long story short, zone them out. Focus on you. People that flame aren't worth it for you. Hell, often times I just come up with creative ways to fire back at them.
Rammus: ""Dude, don't ever play (champ) again. You suck.""Me (2/1/3): ""Stfu bowser, I'm this close to picking your ass up and using you to play fetch with my dog.""
or
Amumu: ""I don't understand how you could be so boosted. Stay bronze dumbass.""Me (3/2/5): ""You ever wonder why you don't have friends? This is why you don't have friends.""
Of course, that being said, don't go this route unless its absolutely hopeless. If the guy is going after you for 15 minutes straight and spends the whole game bringing the team morale down, then you can have some fun giving him a taste of his own medicine. But do your best not to. Stick to my other advice if you can help it

3,How do i deal with toxic players,ı Sona ı,NA, 150 ,2018-11-16T17:13:08.689+0000,1,"You mute them. While I am sympathetic to players being bullied in chat I am forever curious why they don't see muting as a viable option to end the problem. 
When you don't want to watch something, you change the channel. When you don't want to hear something (like some internet pop up advertisement) you mute it. 
If you don't want be flamed in game anymore, you click the button that stops you from seeing their messages.

4,How do i deal with toxic players,Eryl Fauna,NA, 150 ,2018-11-16T17:09:03.123+0000,1,"As you pointed out, lots of people in soloqueue project their negative behavior on other players and it's very wise to mute them early if you see any sign of this.  The only problem then is, of course, they get bored with flaming someone who doesn't respond, and proceed to tell others how bad they are.
If you know your team is getting heated, look for reasons to occasionally compliment them, especially the ones receiving flame.  Everyone is doing something right and they do it a loss less consistently during the rage.  So, remind people what their strengths are.  They will likely take the aggressor less seriously from then on, and focus more on the players who want to help them.  That's my way of getting people to mute the salties without directly telling them to do it, because of course that would only feed the rager.

On my sub account, I play normals because its not level 30, and literally every single game, there is someone constantly flaming.

0,"10 Game Chat Restricted, I dont agree... and I think thats my issue.",TheSaltCollector,NA, 28 ,2018-11-14T21:33:21.556+0000,2,"Ive got a 10 Game Chat Ban now after I thought I had reformed... Im sharing this info to hopefully get some help to answering if Im the issue and the way I am isnt going to change and I should just uninstall. Not just for the community but for myself. Legit asking for help here. 
 I was Perma Suspended a while ago on my OG account. I needed the Perma, it really helped me re evaluate myself and my life style. It probably was one of the largest factors in helping save myself. (Thank you to those who made the healthy decision to ax my OG account, thank you. Honestly, you may have saved my life from my own destructive habits. Sad to say Rioters care more for my bad habits then family. I routinely had members of the community and Rioters ask for me to talk to someone and seek help) Its an understatement to say I was just a regular toxic member of the community. I was one of the worst. I am not gloating or trying to boost ego here. Its a terrible thing to admit and I hate it. I was in such a terrible place and acted terribly. I used to tell stories and lie so much... It never was like that...  I used to be such a uplifting and great person to everyone around me.  The Navy had not worked out for me, and I had dropped out of school shortly after. I had been taking out all my anger, pent up rage and utter hate for myself and just manifested it into in game chat. I developed bad habits and character traits. I didnt work and was a bum living off of others only to get worse. I went and got a job but was hurt at work. Major injury that put me off my feet for 7+ months and threw me into a pill habit that started for pain. During this time I became the most toxic I had ever been. I had such delusions of grandeur. I had not followed my diet plan during my treatment for my injury and had Panda Express. It gave me food poising. With a weakened body because of the pills and my inactivity I was bleeding internally for a while.  I spent time in the hospital because of my habits and ended up quitting cold turkey. I was perma'ed some time after.  Being perma banned and having something I spent so much time on gone gave me time to think and get help.  It helped me identify character defects and grow from it. It helped me seek professional help and talk to people who could help. League of Legends 10+ games a day, everyday is not a healthy hobby. I used to get so angry and would not have fun, yet I still kept playing. I would not attend to chores or focus on schoolwork. I stopped working out and left most of my goals behind. I would always rage and be so mean and cruel to others while playing... it makes me feel disgusted with myself even now. It was doing my own thing in life that showed me what I could be instead of being what I was. I know it isnt much but I am truly sorry to anyone I was toxic to. Sorry for ruining your gaming experience and possibly day/week/month. 
Since kicking what others and myself had identified as toxic behaviors I have grown as an adult and productive member to our society. Kinda a work in progress...
I still played video games, however with less time invested. I began to work more and went out more. More friends and less video games. Less toxic behavior and more uplifting/ positive hobbies. Its been a good year. I have a few pet rats that are awesome and really help me out when I get too antsy. I go out and help clean in my community. I tried church a bit... not my cup of tea but still very positive environments. It has been great. I have a nice little red Prius (fits plenty of salt and the red paint adds 5HP) and I was able to move into my own place. I was able to hold more professional positions in the work place.  Here is an example of me during a surprise news interview for the company I had worked for earlier this year. I was in charge of the States orientations, background checks and general on boarding of new drivers for some time. The position really helped me learn to empathize with others and really helped me learn patience. The old me would have said some really colorful stuff, yelling at Joe to get out of the office and that he was trespassing. I was able to kick out the news reporters in a somewhat professional matter, acting like an adult. Im fortunate enough to be able to go back to school starting next semester so I thought I would try League again...
Anyways, I came back to League of Legends. I still have some bad habits to break. However, the general rage I displayed before is gone.  At times I still get angry but I have come to know how to moderate myself. I had started using an account I had created before I was perma'ed. I wanted to improve my self behavior, and play again. The goal was to get to lv 30 with no bans or chat restrictions. Maybe not be a toxic POS and ruin others experience. I was really really really toxic for sometime, and was not Perma Suspended for a while... like I probably should have been banned a lot earlier on my main for the way I acted. Its embarrassing to reflect back on some of the stuff I have typed out in chat. Childish and I would love to give myself a good talking to. However, the whole point of this post is to show I was chat banned and am still having issues. Sooooooooo ya, if yall could help me identify how I could improve from this game chat, that would be awesome. Cause all I see is I should have just stopped chatting with them sooner.

The chat function is there to communicate.As in goals, strategies, objections, and friendly advice. As soon as you sway off that, you're in the grey area. Depending on what you say, anything that can be deemed offensive can be and will be reviewed if reported. 
The moment you went off saying ""I'm done"" ""report Draven"" ""you're toxic"" and other unrelatable use of the chat that isn't meant for the chat function, you went into the grey area. The IFS doesn't do contexts as context does not matter. So anything that can be considered harassing, offensive, or negative, will trigger a flag.
So if you're on edge, it is best to simply take a break. Come back to the game in a better mood and mindset.

Please learn to use the mute button instead of saying those ""I'm done"" etc messages. ie: Mute the troublesome person instead of talking to him. That will not add to the negative environment experienced by the team and it will save you the time allowing more actions to be taken in game.
I do not know if a break will help you, since I have never been in that situation you are in, but it won't most likely hurt. My advice really is to use that mute button more easily (and do not type ""muted"" but actually mute them instead). Report troublemakers if you think it is appropriate, but do not threaten people with reports (""reported"") and do not report call, those actions only add to the negativity. 
Positive chat usage is still allowed, as long as you can keep it positive. Neutral tone should also be fine, as long as it is gameplay related.

0,And the Training Continues?,Kidnap Kench,NA, 158 ,2018-11-14T14:00:55.341+0000,1," Hey everyone just wanted some thoughts. I've been playing league since 2014.Played every role since then, started as a main jungle->support->adc-> and finally main'd myself as a mid this season. Unfortunately I am the definition of the stuck silver meme. Each season I climb my way up to silver 1 (no joke) and manage to get into multiple rank ups throughout the season. Now I am not claiming to be the best player in the game, nor even perhaps in my league, but I am fairly competent ( I don't feed hard, I scale when I need to, play to my laning strengths, etc etc) this all works out for me. 
What has killed me for four year running now, and yes I said four, is getting multiple leavers/drunk trolls/ try hards, etc in my rank up que's. It's no joke when I say I make it into the que's and almost immediately lose all my games after winning my first one. Its beyond frustrating. Perhaps I'm not suited for this kind of thing, I'm not sure. Anyways, need some help from the community, thoughts ideas, etc. I main mid, and its been my strongest suit next to supporting, my mid main's are heimdinger (I know easy to counter but storng), swain (very easy to counter but strong mid -> late). My strengths lay in combos, and team work, and have an excellent skill shot.
Thanks for your time,

1,And the Training Continues?,LittleOak,NA, 158 ,2018-11-14T15:39:50.828+0000,2,"Personally, as someone who made the climb from B4 to S3 this season (over the span of 2 months August to October) here's the advice I would give:
A. Tighten your champion pool: What I did when I started climbing is I went to champion.gg , I looked at all the junglers (jg main) and I picked 5. No matter what happened, I would only ever play 1 of those 5 champions. Rammus, Kayn, Poppy, Amumu, and Evelynn. I based these champions off of a few factors. Firstly, it's solo/duo queue, it's rare you get someone who wants to play tank, so I decided to pick up more tanks than carries. After that, I looked at champions who had solid winrates for players with less that 50 games played, and who's winrates increased with games played. This clearly gave me information that ""these champions are easy to pick up, and as you learn the nuances to them as you play them, you will get better with them and win more."" Finally I picked champions that fit my playstyle. For example, I am very good at macroplay, watching the map, team fighting, and dueling other champions. My KDAs are crap, but if I die, I almost always get a kill and an assist for it, and if not I'm supporting my team and picking up a lot of assists. This bleeds into my next point..
B. Find a Duo partner you can trust: This has always been a big one for me. If you're having trouble climbing on your own, it's because you're trying to carry 4 other players. If you have a teammate, you only have to carry 3 other player's maximum, but usually less because your teammate will be pulling his part as well (hopefully). Find someone who compliments your strengths. For me, I found 2-3 really good ADCs. Because I picked 3 tanks, most games, I path to level 3 gank bot, get my ADCs 2 kills, back and just repeat gank until they're super ahead and then I build Knight's Vow, and just defend/peel for them going into the mid game and try to win off them scaling early.
C. Change your queue times if possible: I've found out this season, that while trying to climb, all games after 11pm local (for me) on weeknights just don't work. There are so many college students who get stoned or drunk and then think they'll just hop on league and play. I changed my queue times from 10pm-1am to 6-10pm and it's worked wonders. That combined with the above tips really gave me good quality teammates in the right mindset for games. 
D. /Mute all: Your teammates can communicate everything you need to know via pings. If you're in lobby, and people seem to be typing too much, just mute when you get into game. You waste time reading chat, plus if you're duo'ed you can be in voice with your teammate and you two can make calls together. 
Hope this helps, from another Silver scrub. I'll be Gold soon though

2,And the Training Continues?,Jo0o,NA, 158 ,2018-11-14T16:09:33.619+0000,1,"You can’t avoid occasional unwinnable games, so not much sense in preparing for them. Focus on winning the winnable games instead. 
Main thing I noticed glancing at your match history is several high-death games. You can’t carry every game, but you CAN consistently make it easier to BE carried by playing with more caution. Focus on reducing your deaths per game and I’d expect you to climb.

4,And the Training Continues?,Baka Red,EUNE, 158 ,2018-11-14T14:58:47.234+0000,1,"I can understand how leavers and drunk trolls may cause trouble in increasing your rank, but try hards? Why are try hards a problem? Don't they fight to win and always try their hardest? How does that hurt your rank?
Unfortunately I don't really have any answers for you, since ... well, I don't play ranked. 
I can only say that as long as you play as well as you can, statistically your team has less trolls, drunks and whatever negative players than the enemy. Why? Because this way your team has 4 free slots for negative players since your slot is always taken by competent player, while the enemy team has 5 free slots. Each of these ""free"" slot has equal chance to contain a negative player, so at the end, your team will have superior players more often than the enemy team.

You will often make your laner hate the game. You for sure will make the ADC hate the game. You will make pretty much everything except a Sion who free farmed all game hate themselves.

0,Suggestion to help improve the reporting system,SmellyMelly,NA, 96 ,2018-11-13T18:12:11.729+0000,2,"So my thought on improving the system for reporting players is to add the ability to make the chat box interactive so you can flag chat as inappropriate directly there during the game instead of afterward so you don't have to remember per vadum what they typed.
"
1,Suggestion to help improve the reporting system,Umbral Regent,NA, 96 ,2018-11-13T18:15:06.733+0000,2,"You don't need to remember what they typed per vadum. If you know that what they said was negative, inflammatory, etc. - you just report it. The IFS reviews the chat and punishes accordingly.

2,Suggestion to help improve the reporting system,Shyinso,NA, 96 ,2018-11-13T22:26:03.719+0000,-1,"Aside from the fact that the punishments aren't appropriate at all, toxic players, true toxic players walk away unpunished constantly. This happens daily while players who are having a bad day, or just frustrated one game, get chat restricted or banned. The system is useless and Riot does nothing about it.
"
3,Suggestion to help improve the reporting system,Eleshakai,NA, 96 ,2018-11-13T22:52:18.316+0000,2,"1) It's a lot harder to detect in-game toxicity than chat toxicity. Those players often get punished, it just usually takes longer because they don't want to punish anyone for that who was just having a bad game.
2) Unless your 'bad days' involve spouting racial slurs or telling people to kill themselves, you will prettymuch never get punished for a single game. If you got punished, it means you were already on the system's radar because other people had reported you in other games.
3) The system is only called useless by people who get punished and don't believe they deserved to be punished, or by people who genuinely like treating people like crap and hate that the system actually punishes them for that.

0,Honor/Ranked System Unification for better queues.,AngelShocK,NA, 64 ,2018-11-12T21:23:01.295+0000,1,"I have an idea that I want to run by people and to possibly work out and issues as to why this wouldn't work, I personally think its a great idea but obviously you need more than one opinion.
So after my 2nd game in a row of getting afk'd/trolled because some crybaby didn't like that HE wasn't having fun or getting assistance when everywhere else was winning and the game was in our favor. I thought about a system that would separate the toxic players like these people who ruined my game because they felt that our jungler deserved to lose because the jungler didn't help his lane and people like me who have never been banned willing to work with the team even if it means 20 minutes of hell.
If we implemented a system where your honor level mattered in a ranked setting, I think we could achieve this.
The system would work like this, much similar to the honor system now, everyone starts at honor 3 (maybe start at a lower honor level if banned recently for poor behavior?) and the more you're toxic and more legitimate reports against you for being toxic, the lower your honor goes, the more honors you get, the higher you move up in the honor system and have better opportunities of success because you are paired with people who want to work together and climb. Obviously, friend honors would have no effect in this system.
I personally think this could have a huge impact on League of Legends match making and force players to actually cooperate and win or be forever doomed in the queues of people who simply do not care about the game as much as everyone else does.
I predict that this system will be pretty terrible off the start because everyone starts out at a base rating but I think naturally over time the system will weed out the trolls from the good players and will ultimately make League of Legends a fun game to play knowing you aren't rolling a dice to hope that someone on your team isn't that person who is going to ruin your game.
Let me know your thoughts and suggestions. I really want to push this as much as possible or get a better idea of why it couldn't work if it can't.
Cheers!

I play it more than League now. I've played around 2000 ranked games this season. Feeders, trolls, afks, trash players run rampant, like a fuckin plague and it seems they always on my team. This shit really gets exhausting. League hasn't been fun for me for a long time now and to be honest, since picking up HS, I don't really miss League all that much. I still play a bunch of League games but it's not the game I'm thinking about anymore. And when the feeders, trolls and shitheads start pouring in, I'm done. It's HS the rest of the day. 
And you know what I find interesting, being new to HS, I'm losing a shit tonne of games but still enjoying it immensely. When I lose, I know it's because I didn't do shit right and not because some fuckin shithead trashcan fed a Rengar or Leblanc 7 kills and let him run away with the game. Fuck League.
I recommend you find another game or anything you find fun and do that instead. League makes you forget that games are ultimately supposed to be fun and relaxing. It's no fun losing because of shit you have no control over which is what League has become. You can still play League but when it starts to become unfun, you can close it and waste your time on something fun instead. That's where I'm at.

You cannot play poorly, or somebody is going to flame you; and or somebody on the enemy team is going to attempt to take advantage of your patience with over the top banter and bm. In ranked most people are more focused on actually playing the game. Normals for me are always extremely toxic, with players who know exactly what they're doing, and who are actively trying to be as toxic as possible, without the risk of being penalized with a chat restriction. I get that there's a mute button, and I try to take advantage of it whenever I can, but that doesn't just fix this problem. It's not going to stop people from bending over backwards in an attempt to be toxic without getting in trouble.

There is a fine line between these two things and the fact that the annoying people are punished more than someone that says ""your mother dies tonight"" or ""kill yourself"" is ridiculous. I think that anyone that says this should be immediately chat restricted instead of the people that are punished for saying simply next. I've been in numerous amounts of games where someone has been TOXIC and had gotten no punishment.

You can look on these boards and see people do get punished for telling other to kill themselves, or using racial slurs/etc. I've yet to see someone who was ban solely because they said gg in a match. Now granted there is a huge different between saying this once, and repeating it (Spamming it) in chat, thats against the rules, especially when you give us, because more often than not this also means the playing is usually AFK (or faking it why staying at base/fountain) which again helps their case of breaking the rules.

Remember not only is there a Tier system for punishment; meaning that if you did report them and they were punished, more than likely they got a chat restriction which you would never know about because they can still play. But also because even if you do report you wont get the notification of said person being punished. And while that might be good for some people, we sadly have no way of knowing if our reports are actually doing something. But if you been on these boards for a long time, you would see people do get punished (especially with what you are claiming as not being punished) for breaking the rules.
Yes we all can agree Riot needs to give us some way to show that we are being heard, but until that comes we can only hope!

7,the word toxic,Zombie Gerbil,NA, 90 ,2018-11-12T07:06:02.889+0000,1,"Yes, that is true.But negativity is about as frowned upon as toxicity.Because not everyone wants to give up just because one player is having a bad experience. Which can lead to griefing, then that leads to toxicity due to the negative influence. Someone suggesting on FF'n isn't toxic. Everyone does it. But you have to work together when it comes down to the choice if the team wants to give up. If they do not, then don't try to ruin their experience if people want to continue to play by not playing. 
Also realize, just because you don't see a toxic player punished doesn't mean they weren't.Each report counts as they will count as a flag. As these flags stack up, they then lead to a penalty. Every toxic player eventually gets penalized. But the IFS detects two categories; Severity and Consistency. Players do have bad days and lashes out. Doesn't mean you shouldn't report them, because you definitely should. But don't expect a penalty right away. Because the consistency will play its part and give them a penalty from the number of flags. 
It's a team game and you have to work with the team. For better or worst.
